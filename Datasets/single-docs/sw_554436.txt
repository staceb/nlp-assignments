North Jeolla

North Jeolla Province or Jeollabuk-do (전라북도; 全羅北道; Jeollabuk-do) is a province in the southwest of South Korea. The province was formed in 1896 from the north of Jeolla Province. Its provincial capital is Jeonju.

During the Three Kingdoms of Korea period, the province was the center of Mahan, and Mahan became part of Baekje, one of the three Kingdoms. In the Unified Silla period, the towns of Wansan-ju (now Jeonju) and Namwon-gyeong (now Namwon) were started in the province. When King Seongjong of Goryeo divided the whole country into 10 "do"s, Jeolla-do was called Gangnam-do. Later, in the Joseon Dynasty, it was finally called Jeolla-do.

Jeollabuk-do's area is 8,067km² and it occupies 8.1% of South Korea.

The province contains 6 cities and 8 counties.
