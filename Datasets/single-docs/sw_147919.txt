Silver Medal of Military Valor

The Silver Medal of Military Valor (Italian language: "Medaglia d'Argento al Valore Militare") is an Italian medal established in 1833 by King Charles Albert of Sardinia.

During World War I, the medal was awarded to military personnel for exceptional valor in combat. Like the Gold Medal and the Bronze Medal, the Silver Medal was given also to citizens who fought against nazism and fascism during World War II.
