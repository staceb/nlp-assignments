Pope Adrian I

Adrian I (c. 700 – 25 December 795) was Pope from 772 until his death in 795. Soon after he became pope, there was a threat from Desiderius, king of the Lombards. Adrian was forced to ask Charlemagne for help. In 787, there was the Second Council of Nicaea. The council allowed to venerate icons, in certain cases.
