Pig-nosed turtle

The pig-nosed turtle ("Carettochelys insculpta"), also known as the pitted-shelled turtle or Fly River turtle, is a species of turtle native to northern Australia and southern New Guinea.

The Pig-nosed turtle is a very large freshwater turtle, with a shell length of 60-70 centimetres. It is grey to greyish brown in colour on the upper surface, and white to yellow in colour on the lower surface. It has broad paddle-like flippers, each with two claws. Its shell is covered by a soft-pitted skin, instead of the hard scutes that cover the shells of most turtles.
