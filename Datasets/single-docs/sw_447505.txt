Live Through This

Live Through This is the second studio album by Hole. It was released by Geffen Records on April 12, 1994. It got very good reviews. Most of the album was written by Courtney Love and guitarist Eric Erlandson. It was the only Hole album with bassist Kristen Pfaff. Love's husband Kurt Cobain did backing vocals on two songs. Four singles were released from the album, including "Doll Parts". The album was dedicated to Joe Cole, a roadie for Black Flag, who was shot to death during a robbery in December 1991 after attending a Hole show in West Hollywood, California.

Hole's first studio album "Pretty on the Inside" was released in 1991. In March 1992, after the band toured to promote the album, drummer Caroline Rue and bassist Jill Emery left the band. In April 1992 Patty Schemel joined the band as drummer in replacement of Rue. The band moved to Carnation, Washington to a house owned by Love and her husband Kurt Cobain and began writing songs for a second album.

"Rolling Stone" gave the album four out of five stars. "Spin" gave it a score of 10/10.
