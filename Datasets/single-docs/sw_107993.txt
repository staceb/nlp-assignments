Christian hedonism

Christian hedonism is a controversial Christian doctrine in some evangelical churches, partly those of the Reformed tradition. This term was made by Baptist pastor John Piper in his 1986 book "Desiring God". Piper talks about this philosophy of the Christian life as "God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him."
