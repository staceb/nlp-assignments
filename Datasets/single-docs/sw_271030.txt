Notoceratops

Notoceratops (meaning "southern horned face") was a ceratopsian dinosaur known only from a late Cretaceous jaw bone. "Notoceratops" walked on four sturdy legs, had a large head, a bulky body, a parrot-like beak, cheek teeth, and a small frill on its head.

Notoceratops was named by Augusto Tapia in 1918 from a partial lower jaw found in Chubut, Argentina. This original "Notoceratops bonarelli" is missing and there is some doubt as to whether or not this fossil was actually a ceratopsian.
