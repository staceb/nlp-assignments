Savannah monitor

The savannah monitor (or Bosc's monitor) is a medium-sized monitor lizard from Africa. Its scientific name is "Varanus exanthematicus".

Its range extends throughout sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal east to Sudan and south almost to the Congo River and Great Rift Valley. It is a ground-dwelling species which shelters in burrows, although it is sometimes found in bushes or low trees. 

Information about the diet of Savannah monitors in the wild has been recorded in Senegal and Ghana. It feeds almost exclusively on arthropods and molluscs.
