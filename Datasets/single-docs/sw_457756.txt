Showtime Networks

Showtime Networks is a media company that began in New York City in 1983. In the beginning, it was Showtime/The Movie Channel, Inc.. This came about because of a merger among three companies: Showtime, The Movie Channel and Warner-Amex Satellite Entertainment. It was originally owned by Viacom until 2005. That year, the company split into two companies; Viacom and CBS Corporation.

The network is in charge of the company's premium cable television channels, including Showtime.
