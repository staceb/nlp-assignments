Seven Sisters Road

Seven Sisters Road is a road in north London, England. The road runs within the boroughs of Islington, Hackney and Haringey. It is an extension of Camden Road, and runs from Holloway Road (the A1 road) at the Nags Head crossroads then on to another crossroads with Blackstock Road and Stroud Green Road. It carries on uphill alongside Finsbury Park to Manor House, and from there downhill to the junction with Tottenham High Road (the A10 road) at Seven Sisters Corner. The road was authorised in 1829 and constructed in 1833 by the Metropolitan Turnpike Trust. Seven Sisters Road is part of the A503. The stretch running past Finsbury Park is open to the park on the west side, and on the east side are large Victorian villas now used mainly as hotels.
