Dario Fo (Sangiano 3 March 1926 – 13 October 2016) was an Italian playwright, theatre actor and composer. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1997.

His plays often depend on improvisation, "Commedia dell'arte" style. Fo owned and operated a theatre company with his wife, actress Franca Rame. His most famous works are "Mistero buffo" and "Accidental Death of an Anarchist".

Fo died on 13 October 2016 at a hospital in Milan, Italy from a serious lung disease, aged 90.
