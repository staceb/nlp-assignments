Colorful puffleg

The colorful puffleg ("Eriocnemis mirabilis") is a critically endangered hummingbird endemic to Colombia. The colorful puffleg population is estimated as about 250–999 adult birds.

These colorful birds were first found in 1967 by photographer John Dunning who was below Cerro Munchique when he caught the colorful puffleg. He described it as a "miraculous bird".

The male has a shining green head, chest, and upper belly. He has brighter patches of green on his forehead. Both sexes has a bright blue belly, a red and yellow tail, and white feet. The feet have a light cinnamon brown color on them.

In 2005, Swarovski donated funds which allowed the American Bird Conservancy and Fundación ProAves to create a reserve for this species.
