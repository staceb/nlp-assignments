Tejano music

Tejano music or Tex-Mex music (Texas–Mexico music) is a genre of music that originated in South Texas with help from German settlers in the 1800s. Tejano music is a mix-music-genre of German folk, Ranchera, Mariachi, and Conjunto music. The genre became popular during the 1990s. The singer Selena, who was called the "Queen of Tejano music", helped attract younger and wider audiences to Tejano.
