Middle distance race

Middle distance race event is longer than sprints, up to 3000 metres. The standard middle distances are the 800 metres, 1500 metres and the mile run, while the 3000 metres may also be classified as a "middle distance event". The 880 yard run, or half mile, was the forebear to the 800 m distance and it has its roots in competitions in the United Kingdom in the 1830s. The 1500 m came about as a result of running three laps of a 500 m track, which was commonplace in continental Europe in the 20th century.
