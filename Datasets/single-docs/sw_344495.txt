Afro-Bahamian

Afro-Bahamians or Bahamians of African descent are Bahamians whose ancestry is from the continent of Africa. Most are from West Africa. The first Africans in The Bahamas came from Bermuda. They were with the Eleutheran Adventurers as freed slaves looking for a new life.

Currently, Afro-Bahamians are the biggest ethnic group in the Bahamas. They are 85% of the country's people. They have a much higher standard of living than previous generations.
