Lucky Star (song)

"Lucky Star" is the fourth single from Madonna's hit record "Madonna". The song was first released in United Kingdom in 1983. It was originally produced by Reggie Lucas, although during recording Madonna was not happy with the final results of the song. According to her, Lucas used too many instruments and did not consider her ideas for the song. She called her boyfriend (at the time), John Benitez, to remix her songs. When the "Lucky Star" video was released in 1984, her style and mannerisms became a fashion trend among younger people.
