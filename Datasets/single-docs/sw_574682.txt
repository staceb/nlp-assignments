Sabra

A sabra, Hebrew: צבר‎‎ - tzabar, is a Jew who is born in Ottoman Palestine, Mandatory Palestine or in the State of Israel. As of 2015, about three quarters of the Israeli Jews are sabras.

The term "sabra" is derived from the prickly pear. Like this cactus a sabra is supposed to be hard on the outside but soft on the inside.
