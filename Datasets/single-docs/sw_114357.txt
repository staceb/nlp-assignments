Club (weapon)

A club (also known as cudgel, baton, truncheon, night stick, and bludgeon) is a weapon mainly used to hit someone or something. A club is a short staff, or stick, usually made of wood, and used as a weapon. 

A club can be used in one or two hands, but it is usually used in one hand. A quarterstaff is a clubs that needs both hands to be used. Many kinds of clubs are used in martial arts and other fields, including the law enforcement baton.

The wounds caused by a club are known as "bludgeoning" or "blunt-force trauma" injuries. In the United States, clubs are not as popular as the taser.
