Drive-in

A drive-in is a place (such as a restaurant or movie theater) where customers drive in with a car for service. 

At a drive-in restaurant waiters are called carhops. They take food orders from drivers in their parked cars then return with the food. Drive-in theaters have a large screen and a car parking area.
