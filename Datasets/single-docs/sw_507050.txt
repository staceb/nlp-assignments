Fredrik Fasting Torgersen

Fredrik Ludvig Fasting Torgersen (1 October 1934 – 19 June 2015) was a Norwegian man who was convicted of murder in 1958. Serving 16 years in prison before being released, he has claimed his innocence many times. 

In 2013 Bjørg Njaa, a daughter of a judge in the 1958 trial said that her father was prejudiced against Torgersen even before being assigned to the trial. In 2014 he was denied access to official recordings of then leader of the Norwegian Board of Forensic Medicine, Bjørnar Olaisen, answering to Criminal Cases Review Commission.
