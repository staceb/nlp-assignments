The Sable Quean

The Sable Quean is a children's fantasy novel. It was written by Brian Jacques in 2010, and it's the twenty-first book in the Redwall series.

The evil Vilaya, who's a sable (that's a kind of animal) queen, wants to take over Redwall Abbey. To do this, she kidnaps children from the Abbey and the area around it, so that if the woodlanders want their kids back, they'll have to give her their abbey.

Luckily, several good guys come to the rescue. But will the good guys and the good Redwallers be able to win against the Sable Quean?
