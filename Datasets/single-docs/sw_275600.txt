Rhynchosaur

Rhynchosaurs were a group of Triassic diapsid reptiles related to the archosaurs. They were herbivores, and at times abundant (in some fossil localities accounting for 40 to 60% of specimens found), with stocky bodies and a powerful beak.

They became extinct at the End-Triassic extinction event.
