Crazy Horse (cabaret)

Le Crazy Horse Saloon or Le Crazy Horse Paris is a nightclub in Paris, founded in 1951. It is famous for its cabaret, which features nude female dancers. It was opened by Alain Bernardin, who also managed it until his suicide in 1994. Today the cabaret is run by Bernardin's children.

The franchise includes "Crazy Horse Paris" for one in Las Vegas (formerly La Femme), at the MGM Grand. 

Other cabarets with similar names are separate enterprises.
