Coriaria myrtifolia

Coriaria myrtifolia, called in English redoul, is a plant with poisonus fruits and whose leaves were traditionally used as raw material in tanning (making leather out of skins).

The Spanish name "emborrachacabras" (that is, "getting goats drunk") refers to the leaves' effect on goats that eat them. The French name ("redoul") and Catalan name ("roldor") come from Latin "Rhus tyrius" (Syrian or Tyrian sumac), referring to the leaves use in the traditional tannery industry, to make "Basil" leather.

"C. myrtifolia" is a shrub to 2–3 m tall without hairs and with shiny leaves like the leaves of the myrtle ("myrtifolia" means "leaves like the leaves of the myrtle"). It produces small greenish flowers in spring (April to June) in racemes (a kind of inflorescence).
It produces fruits in early summer. The fruits look like berries but they are small nuts (achenes) protected by enlarged and colored petals; it is the same of all the species of the genus "Coriaria". Fruits cannot be eaten because their seeds are very poisonous.

The plants of redoul can fix nitrogen from the air because they have bacteria in their roots.

"C. myrtifolia" is found only around the western Mediterranean Sea, not too far from the coast but near rivers:
