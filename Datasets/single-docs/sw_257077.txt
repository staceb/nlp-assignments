You Never Give Me Your Money

"You Never Give Me Your Money" is a song by The Beatles that opens the medley on side two of the album "Abbey Road". It was written by Paul McCartney and is credited to Lennon/McCartney.

The Beatles recorded 26 takes of "You Never Give Me Your Money" on May 6, 1969, with McCartney on piano and vocals, Lennon and Harrison on guitar and Starr on drums. 

On July 1, McCartney overdubbed lead vocals onto take 30, and added more vocals and chimes on July 15.

"You Never Give Me Your Money" was originally to transition into "Sun King" with a long organ note. This was recorded along with more vocals on July 30. They were scrapped the following day, when McCartney completed the song by adding bass guitar and piano. The "Sun King" crossfade was completed on August 5 with a series of tape loops containing the sounds of bells, birds, bubbles and insects.
