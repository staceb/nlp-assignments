Peter Sarstedt

Peter Eardley Sarstedt (10 December 1941 – 8 January 2017) was an English singer, instrumentalist and award-winning songwriter. He was the brother of musicians Eden Kane and Robin Sarstedt. His music was traditional folk music rather than traditional rock and roll. 

He was best known for writing and performing the single "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?". It topped the UK Singles Chart in 1969 and won the Ivor Novello Award along with "Space Oddity" by David Bowie. Sarstedt remained a one-hit wonder, despite having released numerous successful albums and singles beginning from the late 1960s and releasing two singles a year from 1967 until 1987, with the popular track "Frozen Orange Juice" and the novelty song "Take off Your Clothes" entering the top ten.

Sarstedt had progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) since 2015. He died on 8 January 2017 in Sussex at the age of 75.
