Figurative language

Figurative language is when a writer describes something by comparing it with something else. It is writing that goes from the actual meaning to get a special meaning.
Figurative language is a difference in fields of language analysis. Literal language is about words that do not go away from their meaning. Non-literal or figurative language refers to words, and groups of words, that change the normal meanings of the words. A literal usage is the "normal" meanings of the words. It has the same meaning regardless of the context.The intended meaning is the same as the real meaning of the individual words. Figurative use of language is the use of words or phrases in a manner where the literal meaning of the words is not true or does not make sense. It "implies a non-literal meaning which does make sense or that could be true".
