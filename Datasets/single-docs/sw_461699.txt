Claridge's

Claridge's is a 5-star hotel in Mayfair, London. It was founded in 1812 as Mivart's Hotel, demolished and rebuilt in 1898 by its new owner Richard D'Oyly Carte. This was done to install modern facilities such as lifts and "en suite" bathrooms. It became part of D'Oyly Carte's Savoy Group of hotels.

Claridge's is now owned by the Maybourne Hotel Group, which also owns the Berkeley and the Connaught, two other luxury hotels in London. Claridges has 203 rooms and suites, is hugely expensive. Rooms start at USD $904 per night, suites start at USD $1,791 per night, penthouses start at USD $7,000 per night. However, hotel booking websites do show lower prices at some times of the year.

To a visitor the best aspect is the interior design in art deco style. There is a huge central area or atrium, where afternoon tea is served, and coffee after breakfast and dinner. There are two large restaurants, and various bars and other facilities.

The BBC 2 produced a three-part television documentary about Claridge's, called "Inside Claridge's", shown in 2012..
