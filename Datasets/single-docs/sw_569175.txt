Ad astra (phrase)

Ad astra is a Latin phrase meaning "to the stars". The phrase has origins with Virgil, who wrote ' ("thus one journeys to the stars", from Aeneid book IX, line 641, spoken by Apollo to Aeneas's young son Iulus) and ' ("desire to pursue the high (or hard to reach) stars on wings" book XII, lines 892–893, spoken by Aeneas to his foe Turnus in their combat).

Another origin is Seneca the Younger, who wrote "" ("there is no easy way from the earth to the stars", Hercules Furens, line 437, spoken by Megara, Hercules' wife).
