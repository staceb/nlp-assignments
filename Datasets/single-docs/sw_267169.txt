Changi

Changi is a place in the east of Singapore. It has Changi Airport, Singapore Expo, Changi Air Base and Changi Naval Base.

Singapore had its international airport at Kallang and Paya Lebar. But it expanded so rapidly that the Singapore government worried about having not enough space for airport to grow bigger. There were many proposals for a new location and the Singapore government chose Changi in the end.

There are also other places in Changi, for example the Changi Prison, which had the Japanese Prisoner-of-war (POW) camps. These camps had the Allied powers prisoners staying there.

There is also the Changi Air Base, Changi Naval Base, Changi Point Ferry Terminal and Changi Ferry Terminal.

There are many ways to get to Changi. The easiest way is to take the Mass Rapid Transit which goes straight to the heart of Changi Airport. However, there are also buses and taxis available.
