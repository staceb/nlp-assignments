Troglodytae

The Troglodytae () or Troglodyti (meaning "cave goers"), used to be a group of people talked about by many old Greek and Roman historians and map makers. The early references call them Trogodytes, which looks like it was changed from the Greek "trōglē" meaning "cave". They were either placed in the desert along the African side of the Red Sea coast or North of Greece in what they called Getae.
