Luxor Temple

Luxor Temple is an Ancient Egyptian temple, located in modern-day Luxor, which was known as Thebes at the time. The temple was dedicated to the god Amun, his wife Mut, and their son Chons. The temple was built during the time of the New Kingdom. Because some of the stones were re-used, an older monument was probably there beforehand, during the 12th dynasty. Some of the stones of the temple were later re-used to build Abu el-Haggag mosque. 

Together with the Temple at Karnak, Luxor Temple is on the list of World Heritage Sites. 

Note that Luxor Temple is different from the necropolis of Hatshepsut, located in Deir el-Bahari, which is also near Luxor.
