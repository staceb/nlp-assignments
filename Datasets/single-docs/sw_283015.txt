Spiritual séance

Spiritual séance or, simply, Séance is a meeting at which a group of people often including a medium attempts to contact a ghost and communicate with it. Participants of such meeting need not be seated while engaged in a séance.

One of the earliest books on the subject is "Communitation With the Other Side" by George, First Baron Lyttelton, published in England in 1760.

Some notable people who attended séances and believed in all that include the United States President Abraham Lincoln, and his wife Mary Todd Lincoln; the social reformer Robert Owen; the journalist and pacifist William Thomas Stead, and more.

Scientists who have conducted a search for real séances and believed that contact with the dead is a reality include the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace, the inventor of telephone Alexander Graham Bell, and the inventor of television technology John Logie Baird, who claimed to have contacted the spirit of the inventor Thomas Edison, and more.
