Labour Briefing

Labour Briefing is a monthly political magazine made by members of the British Labour Party. The magazine was started in 1980 as London Labour Briefing.

Throughout the 1990s, "London Labour Briefing" lost supporters and influence as New Labour's hold over the Labour Party increased. This was also because control inside the Labour Party was centralised, and the role played by activists was reduced.

"London Labour Briefing" was renamed "Labour Briefing" and was then known as "Labour Left Briefing". In 2008 it was changed back to "Labour Briefing" on merging with "Voice of the Unions". It supports the Socialist Campaign Group of Members of Parliament, and aims to promote and build the network of local Campaign Groups.
