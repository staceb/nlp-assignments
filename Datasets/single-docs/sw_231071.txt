Houses of the Holy is the fifth album from rock band Led Zeppelin, released on March 28 1973, but recorded in 1972. This album has many different music styles on it, like reggae, funk, acoustic songs and folk-like rock songs. Many fans and critics thought when the album was released, that it was not as good as the album they made two years earlier, Led Zeppelin IV, but today it is seen as one of their best albums. Songs like "The Song Remains the Same", "No Quarter", "Over the Hills and Far Away" and "The Rain Song" were performed for almost all tours after the release of the album. "The Song Remains the Same" is also the title of their 1976 movie, but recorded in 1973 and 1974.
