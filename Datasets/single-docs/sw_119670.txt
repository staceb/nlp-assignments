Genogram

A genogram is a family tree with medical details, such as whether the person is male or female, and whether brothers and sisters are twins. Genograms help medics understand a person better.

One of the advantages of a genogram is the ability to use colour-coded lines to define different types of relationships such as family relationships, emotional relationships and social relationships. Within family relationships, you can illustrate if a couple is married, divorced, common-law, engaged, etc.
