Conservation biology

Conservation biology is the study of the nature and status of Earth's biodiversity, aimed to protect species, their habitats, and ecosystems from threatening to extinction. It combines subjects ranged from sciences to economics and the practice of natural resource management. The name "conservation biology" was introduced as the title of a meeting held at the University of California in 1978. Both conservation biology and the concept of biodiversity influence conservation policy.
