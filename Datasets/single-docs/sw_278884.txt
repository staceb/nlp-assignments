Prince-elector

Prince-electors were the group of rulers of German countries which elected the Holy Roman Emperor. In English they were usually called "Electors" and included the Elector of Brandenburg, who also began ruling as King of Prussia, and the Electors of Hanover, who were also kings of Great Britain after 1714.
