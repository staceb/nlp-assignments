Burhanuddin Rabbani

Burhanuddin Rabbani (1940 — 20 September 2011) was the President of Afghanistan from 1992 to 1996. He had been a Mujahideen leader who fought against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. He was removed as President when the Taliban took over in 1996. He then became the leader of the Northern Alliance which took over in Kabul when the Taliban were removed. He became the head of Afghanistan's High Peace Council which was trying to find a way to end the fighting in Afghanistan. He was killed in a suicide attack on his home. A man who claimed to be a Taliban leader met with Rabbini, and then exploded a bomb, which he had hidden in his turban.
