Odometer

An odometer or odograph is an instrument that shows the distance traveled by a vehicle, such as a bicycle or automobile. It can be electronic, mechanical, or a combination of the two. The name comes from the Greek words "hodós" ("path" or "gateway") and "métron" ("measure"). It is sometimes called a mileometer or milometer.
