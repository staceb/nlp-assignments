Rocka Rolla

Rocka Rolla is the first studio album by British heavy metal band, Judas Priest. "Rocka Rolla" was released on 6 September 1974 through both Gull Records. The album was produced by Rodger Bain, who had produced the first three albums for Black Sabbath.

When the album was released, it was met with a small reception and sold "only a few thousand copies". Due to the flop of the album, Judas Priest had found themselves financially in dire straits. The band said that there were nights where they were starving and that they didn't know when they were going to get their next meal. They tried to make an agreement with Gull to pay them 50 pounds a week, but the record label was also not doing well financially and they did not agree.

The album featured the single "Rocka Rolla".
