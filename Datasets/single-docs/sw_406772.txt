Western saloon

A Western saloon is a type of bar that was popular during the Old West.

The very first saloon was created in Brown's Hole, Wyoming, in 1822 and served fur trappers. Some of the saloons offered dancing girls, some of them sometimes doubled as prostitutes. A lot of saloons offered poker, faro, brag, dice games, three-card monte, billiards, darts, and bowling. Some saloons included piano players, can-can girls, and theatrical skits. During his lifetime, Wyatt Earp owned and worked in many saloons.
