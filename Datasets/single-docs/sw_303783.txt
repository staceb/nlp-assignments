Enterovirus

Enteroviruses are a group of viruses that usually live in the gut of humans and other mammals. Most do not cause disease there. They can cause a mild form of meningitis, which is an infection near the brain. Some members of this group of viruses, such as poliovirus, can sometimes be more dangerous. They are viruses made for RNA and there are many different kinds of them.
