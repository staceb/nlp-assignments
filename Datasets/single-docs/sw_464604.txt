National Statuary Hall Collection

The National Statuary Hall Collection in the United States Capitol is a collection of statues donated by individual states to honor people very important in their history. Originally set up in the old Hall of the House of Representatives, renamed National Statuary Hall, the expanding collection has since been spread throughout the Capitol.

With the addition of New Mexico's second statue in 2005, the collection is now complete with 100 statues by each 50 states. Alabama, Arizona, California, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan and Ohio each replaced one of their first two statues a few years after Congress authorized replacements. The most recent state to replace a statue was Ohio, which replaced its statue of William Allen with one of Thomas Edison in September 2016.
