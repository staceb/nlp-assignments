Gravitropism

Gravitropism (also known as Geotropism) is a turning or growth movement by a plant, fungus, or animal in response to gravity. It is a general feature of all higher and many lower plants and also in other organisms. Charles Darwin was one of the first people to say that roots grow downward and stems grow upward in response to gravity.
