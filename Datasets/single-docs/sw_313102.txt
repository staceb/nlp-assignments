Garageland

Garageland is a song by English punk rock band The Clash, featured on their first album, "The Clash".
Upon The Clash's appearance at the Sex Pistols 'Screen on the Green' concert, NME critic Charles Shaar Murray said:

""The Clash are the kind of garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately, preferably with the engine running, which would undoubtedly be more of a loss to their friends and families than to either rock or roll.""

The Clash responded immediately by writing the song 'Garageland'. The opening verses are: ""Back in the garage with my bullshit detector" / "Carbon monoxide makes sure it's effective"", followed by the chorus: ""We're a garage band" / "We come from garageland"", and concluding with ""Back in the garage"".

Yet, only two years later, Murray was describing the band as ""the greatest rock band in the world"" in the same paper.
