He used force to become king. He changed the constitution of the Roman Kingdom to give himself complete power and used violence to rule. Many members of the Senate were killed and not replaced. He built large monuments, including a fortified temple. He and his family were forced to leave Rome after a revolt by the people. His son Sextus Tarquinius had raped Lucretia, a married noblewoman. Tarquinius Superbus died in Cumae.
