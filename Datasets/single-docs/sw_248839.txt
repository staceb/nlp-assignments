New Found Glory

New Found Glory (used to be "A New Found Glory") is an American rock band from Coral Springs, Florida. They formed in 1997. Founding members were lead vocalist Jordan Pundik, guitarists Chad Gilbert and Steve Klein, bassist Ian Grushka and drummer Joe Moreno. Current drummer Cyrus Bolooki replaced Moreno after only a handful of shows and the lineup has since remained unchanged. Their kind of music is said to have come from bands such as bands Green Day and NOFX, to hardcore acts like Hatebreed and Madball. The band are known for their mix of pop melodies with the energy and fast tempos of classic punk rock. Because of this, they are now widely known as a key pioneer in the fusion genre of pop punk. They are also noted for their wild live performances.
