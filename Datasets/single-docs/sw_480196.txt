Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi

Sajida Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi ( born c. 1970-4 February 2015) was a Iraqi failed suicide bomber. She has been convicted in the November 9, 2005 Amman bombings in Jordan but survived when her explosive belt failed to detonate. Al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for the triple bombings that hit three hotels.

She was sentenced to death as a result of her involvement in the hotel suicide bombings. Jordan executed her on February 4, 2015 in response for the execution of Jordanian pilot Muath Al-Kasasbeh by the ISIS terrorist organization. Jordan had expressed willingness to swap al-Rishawi in exchange for the pilot's safe return, however the pilot had already been killed.
