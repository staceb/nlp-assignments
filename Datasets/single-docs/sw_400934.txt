Comédie-Française

The Comédie-Française or Théâtre-Français is one of the few state theatres in France. It is the only state theatre to have its own company of actors. The company's primary venue is the Salle Richelieu. The theatre is part of the Palais-Royal complex at 2 rue de Richelieu on the Place André-Malraux in the 1st arrondissement of Paris.

The theatre has also been known as the "Théâtre de la République" and "La maison de Molière" (English: House of Molière). It inherited the latter name from the troupe of the best-known playwright associated with the Comédie-Française, Molière. He was considered the patron of French actors. He died seven years before “La maison de Molière” was rechristened the “Comédie-Française,” and the company continued to be known popularly by the former name long after the official change of name.

The Comédie-Française today has a repertoire of 3,000 works and three theatre locations in Paris (salle Richelieu; théâtre du Vieux-Colombier; Studio-Théâtre)
