Content word

A content word is a word in a language that has meaning. The most common content words are nouns, verbs, adjective, and adverbs. Unlike function words, content words are usually open class, which means that there is no end to how many words a part of speech in a language can have. Since content words are usually more important in a sentence, they tend to be said with more stress in an English sentence.
