Roman Catholicism in Canada

The Roman Catholic Church in Canada is part of the world wide Catholic Church. As of 2008, it was the third largest religious body in Canada. Over 13 million Canadians (46% of population) was a baptized member of the Catholic Church.

Catholics first settled in Canada in the 1600s, when French settlers founded Quebec City. In the 1620s, British Catholics were allowed to settle on Newfoundland. A seminary was started in Quebec City in 1663. In 1674, Pope Clement X started a diocese in Quebec City, which was the first episcopal see in the Americas north of Mexico. This diocese became the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec in 1819. The diocese originally covered all of Canada but other diocese were created during the 19th century.
