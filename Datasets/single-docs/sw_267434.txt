Minimum efficient scale

The minimum efficient scale (MES) is the smallest output that an industrial plant (or firm) can produce such that its long run average costs are minimised. The size of MES relative to market demand curve has a strong influence on market structure. It can also be defined as the minimum point in U-shaped long run average cost curve.
