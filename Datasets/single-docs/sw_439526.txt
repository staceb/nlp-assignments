Heart cancer

Heart cancer is cancer that involves different regions of the heart. It is extremely rare. Many types of the disease includes myxomas, fibromas, rhabdomyomas, and hamartomas. 

In a study of 12,487 autopsies performed in Hong Kong seven cardiac tumors were found, most of which were benign. According to Mayo Clinic: "At Mayo Clinic, on average only one case of heart cancer is seen each year."
