Robert Wilson

Robert Woodrow Wilson (born 10 January 1936) is an American Nobel Prize-winning astronomer. He found part of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964. He was working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in New Jersey on an antenna with Arno Penzias. This antenna picked up any background 'noise' they could not get rid of. Their findings were justified by others predictions. Fourteen years later, they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery.
