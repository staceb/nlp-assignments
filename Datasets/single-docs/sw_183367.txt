Ashbourne

Ashbourne is a small town in the county of Derbyshire in England. 7,000 people live there. Ashbourne is known for a football match where one half of the town plays the other at football, using the whole of the town with the goals three miles apart.

A walk and cycle path starts on the northern part of the town, and follows the course of the former railway to Buxton. The walk is called the "Tissington Trail".
