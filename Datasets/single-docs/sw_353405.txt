Second Alcibiades

Second Alcibiades (also called Alcibiades II or Alcibiades minor) is a text in Ancient Greek. It is a dialogue. Originally, it was attributed to Plato, but today it is thought Plato was not the author. In the dialogue, Socrates talks to the young Alcibiades. Alcibiades later became a successful statesman and general. The two people talk about philosophical aspects of prayer. The starting point of the question is how prayer should be performed correctly, and what to pray for.
