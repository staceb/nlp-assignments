Blackcomb Peak

Blackcomb Peak is a mountain near the east of Whistler, British Columbia, Canada. It is the boundary between the Whistler Blackcomb ski resort and the Garibaldi Provincial Park. The slopes were host to the sliding sports during the 2010 Winter Olympics. There is a memorial ice axe bolted to the rocks just below the summit to honour extreme skier Trevor Peterson.
