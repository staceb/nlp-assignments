Yellow Mama

Yellow Mama is the nickname given to Alabama's electric chair, which was used for executions from 1927–2002.

It was used at Kilby State Prison in Montgomery, Alabama. Yellow Mama was painted with highway-line paint from the State Highway Department lab. The chair was built by a British inmate in 1927 and was first used the same year.
