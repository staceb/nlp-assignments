Darwin Day

Darwin Day is celebrated in the United States on 12 February, the birthday of Charles Darwin. This recognizes the importance of his book "The Origin of Species", the basis of the theory of evolution. The decision was taken by the US Congress. 

The date is not widely known or celebrated in the UK. However, 2009 was the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth and was also the 150th anniversary of the publication of "Origin of Species". Events were planned, with celebrations in Shrewsbury (his birthplace), the University of Cambridge, and the Natural History Museum in London.
