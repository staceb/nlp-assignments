Segnosaurus

Segnosaurus (meaning "slow lizard") was a herbivorous theropod dinosaur that lived during the late Upper Cretaceous, about 93 million years ago. It was a rather large Therizinosaur. This is a family of theropods which were herbivores. They changed from the usual carnivorous lifestyle of their ancestors.

Four partial skeletons of "Segnosaurus" have been found in Mongolia. It had a long flexible neck, long head, three-toed feet, a broad strong pelvis, stocky legs with clawed fingers and toes, and a short tail. In 2010 Gregory Paul estimated the body length at six metres, the weight at 1.3 tonnes.
