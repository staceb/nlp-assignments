Aluminium antimonide

Aluminium antimonide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is AlSb. It has aluminium and antimonide ions in it. Compounds like it, such as gallium antimonide and indium antimonide can be made into LEDs and detectors for Infrared radiation but aluminium antimonide doesn't work as well. It is used instead to make the other compounds work better by stopping defects forming as they are made. 

Aluminium antimonide is a black solid. It is a semiconductor. It reacts with acids to make stibine. It is a reducing agent. It has properties between a salt and an alloy.
