Scott Walker

Scott Kevin Walker (born November 2, 1967) is an American Republican politician. He is the 45th Governor of Wisconsin. He is a two-term Governor, elected in 2010 and 2014.

Walker was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. His family moved to Plainfield, Iowa and later to Delavan, Wisconsin. He studied at Marquette University, but did not graduate.

Walker began his political career in the Wisconsin State Assembly, serving from 1993–2002. After the 2002 resignation of Tom Ament as Executive of Milwaukee County, Walker won the special election to fill the seat, which he held from 2002 to 2010.

Walker was elected governor of Wisconsin in 2010, defeating the Democratic nominee, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett. 

After being sworn into office in 2011, Walker introduced a budget repair plan which limited many collective bargaining powers for most public employees. The legislation led to significant protests at the Wisconsin State Capitol and an effort to recall Walker. 

In June 2012, Walker faced Barrett in Wisconsin's only gubernatorial recall election. After emerging as the winner, Walker became the only governor in the U.S. to date to win a gubernatorial recall election.

Walker married Tonette Tarantino in 1993. Together, they have 2 children.

Walker has been seen by many as a potential candidate for the GOP's nomination in the 2016 presidential election. He formed a 527 organization in January of 2015. On June 18, 2015 Walker took a further step towards a presidential campaign when he established a "testing-the-waters" federal campaign committee. 

Walker announced his presidential campaign on July 13, 2015 on his Twitter account. On September 21 2015, Walker suspended his campaign after low polling numbers.
