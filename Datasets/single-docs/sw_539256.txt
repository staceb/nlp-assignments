Billy Redmayne

Billy Redmayne (1990/1991 – 19 April 2016) was a Manx soldier and motorcycle racer. He was born Laxey. He served in the Parachute Regiment in the War in Afghanistan. By 2013 he was able to devote all of his time to racing. He won the Newcomers Manx Grand Prix in 2014 and the Junior Manx Grand Prix a year later.

On 17 April 2016 he was hit from behind by another competitor in a crash at the Oliver's Mount Spring Cup in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. He was airlifted to James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough. His brain injuries were too severe for him to recover, and his partner and family made a decision for his life support to be switched off and his organs donated. He died two days after the accident on 19 April at the age of 25.
