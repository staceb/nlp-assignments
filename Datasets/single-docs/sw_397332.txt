J.R. Ewing

John Ross "J.R." Ewing, Jr. is a fictional character in the hit U.S. television series "Dallas" (1978–1991) and its spin-offs, including the revived "Dallas" series (2012–2013). The character was portrayed by actor Larry Hagman from the series premiere in 1978 until his death in late 2012.

One of the show's most iconic figures, J.R. has been central to many of the series' biggest storylines. He is shown as a villainous selfish oil baron with psychopathic tendencies, who is constantly plotting subterfuges to plunder his foes and their wealth. Hagman was the only actor to appear in all 357 episodes of the series.

Hagman died on November 23, 2012, and "Dallas" producers subsequently announced that J.R. would be killed off in the second season. The episode "The Furious And Fast" dealt with J.R's death. Ewing was on the phone with his son saying he had one last plan to get back at another richman. Ewing's son heard gunshots which would eventually kill J.R.

Ewing is considered one of television's most popular characters, with "TV Guide" naming him #1 in their 2013 list of The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time.
