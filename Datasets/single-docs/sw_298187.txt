Looe

Looe is a small coastal town and fishing port in southeast Cornwall, United Kingdom. As of the 2001 census, 5,280 people lived there. Looe is divided into two parts by the River Looe, East Looe and West Looe being connected by a bridge. The town is about 20 miles (32 km) west of the city of Plymouth and seven miles (11 km) south of Liskeard. 

The town is around a small harbour and along the steep-sided valley of the River Looe which flows south to the English Channel beside a sandy beach. Off shore to the west is the picturesque Looe Island.
