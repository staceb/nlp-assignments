Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol

"Cigarettes & Alcohol" is the fourth single off English rock band Oasis' debut studio album "Definitely Maybe". The song was released in 10 October 1994. The song was Oasis' second song to enter the UK top ten in the United Kingdom. The song was able to reach #7. It spent 35 weeks on the charts and re-entered Top 75 charts on several occasions until 1997.

It is the second case where Oasis was accused of plagiarism, the first being "Shakermaker". The main riff of Cigarettes & Alcohol is allegedly "borrowed" from "Get It On" by T. Rex, as well as "Little Queenie" by Chuck Berry. The song also bears a similarity to the opening of Humble Pie's cover of "C'mon Everybody".
