Interstate 787

Interstate 787 (I-787) is an Interstate Highway in the U.S. state of New York. It goes through downtown Albany. The southern end is at the toll plaza for New York State Thruway (I-87) exit 23. The location of the northern end is unclear. Some sources say it is at 8th Street in Troy. Other sources say it is at its interchange with NY 7 and NY 787 in the town of Colonie.

The route is long if extended to Troy, or without the NY 7 overlap.

North of NY 7, the highway continues as NY 787 to the city of Cohoes.
