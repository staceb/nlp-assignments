Sol (colloid)

A sol is a colloidal suspension of very small solid particles in a continuous liquid medium. They can be quite stable; examples include blood, pigmented ink, and paint.

Sols can change into viscosity quickly if they are thixotropic. Examples include quicksands and paint, both of which become more fluid under pressure.
