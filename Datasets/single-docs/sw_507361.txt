Pokémon Colosseum

The concept for "Pokémon Colosseum" was influenced by RPGs like "Final Fantasy VII" and "". During an interview with Prima Games, "Pokémon" director Junichi Masuda was asked why the gameplay did not mirror that of the other games in the series. Masuda said "How players communicate with each other has been key to the "Pokémon" games – it is the backbone of all "Pokémon" game designs. I feel that the handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game."

The game was first shown at E3 2003.

IGN rated the game a 7.5 out of 10. Craig Harris of IGN said that the "Pokémon" RPG's move to 3D "does a decent enough job" and is "a bit more linear and straightforward".

In 2006, "Nintendo Power" ranked the game as the 121st greatest video game to appear on a Nintendo console.
