Meyerasaurus

Meyerasaurus is an extinct genus of plesiosaur. An almost complete fossil was found in Holzmaden, Baden-Württemberg, southeastern Germany. It was a medium-sized, 3.35 m (11.0 ft) long, pliosaur.

The specimen was collected from shale over 150 years ago. The shale dates to the early Jurassic, about 183–180 million years ago (mya). The specimen was described as a species of "Plesiosaurus" a hundred years ago. It got its new name in 2010.

Most members of its family, the Rhomaleosauridae, have been found in England. They were found in the lower Blue Lias deposits which date to the earliest Jurassic, just above the boundary with the Triassic.
