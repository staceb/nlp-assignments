The Scream (1893)

The Scream is Edvard Munch's most famous painting. It is an example of modern art. 

The picture shows an imaginary creature with its mouth and eyes open. It is screaming in fear.

Munch got the idea for the painting when he was walking with friends. It was sunset and the sky was red, like the color of blood. Munch heard a sound in his ears, like the sound of nature screaming.

The painting was made with oil, tempera and pastel on cardboard. The size of the painting is 91 x 73.5 cm (35 7/8 x 29"). The painting is in the Nasjonalgalleriet (National Gallery) in Oslo, Norway. 

From 1893 to 1910, Munch made four paintings of “The Scream”. Three of the paintings are in Norwegian museums. The fourth painting has a private owner. 

In 1994, thieves stole the painting from the Norwegian National Gallery. Three months later, the painting was found. The value of the painting is about $55 million.
