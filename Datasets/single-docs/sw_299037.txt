Rhytidectomy

A rhytidectomy (commonly called a facelift) is a type of cosmetic surgery procedure used to make a person's face look younger. Rhytidectomy usually involves the removal of excess facial skin, which cause wrinkles, and the redraping of the skin on the patient's face and neck. The tightening of underlying tissues of the face is optional. Nearly 112,955 face lift procedures were performed in the United States in the year 2010 alone according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.
