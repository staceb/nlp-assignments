Bangsamoro Republik

The Bangsamoro Republik, officially the United Federated States of Bangsamoro Republik () was a former unrecognized breakaway territory in the Philippines. All countries consider the Bangsamoro Republik to be part of the Philippines. Nur Misuari, the chaiman of the Moro National Liberation Front declared the independence of the Bangsamoro Republik in Talipao, Sulu. Davao City is declared to be the capital of the state.

It was said to be a federal republic. The government was in exile. According to Misuari, the republic's territory covers the islands of Basilan, Mindanao, Palawan, Sulu and Tawi-Tawi. These are places where the Bangsamoro traditionally lived. But according to Emmanuel Fontanilla, Bangsamoro Republik also includes the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak. Fontanilla is Misuari's legal counsel.
