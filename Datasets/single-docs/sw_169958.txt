First Folio

The First Folio is the common name for the first collection of William Shakespeare's plays. It was published in 1623. Its title is Mr. William Shakespeares Comedies, Histories, & Tragedies. The collection was assembled by Shakespeare's theatrical colleagues, John Heminges and Henry Condell. 

Four plays are missing: "Pericles, Prince of Tyre", "The Two Noble Kinsman", and the "lost plays" "Cardenio" and "Love's Labours Won". It is believed about 750 copies were originally published. Two hundred twenty-eight remain in existence. The Folger Library in Washington, D. C. holds the most copies at 82. Copies that arrive at auction realize prices in the millions.
