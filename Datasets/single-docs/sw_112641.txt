Credit

When somebody borrows resources from somebody else, credit is the trust that they will later pay it back. The term often is used when somebody borrows money from a bank. This is called a loan. A bank may not give somebody credit if they do not think they would pay the loan back.

A bank or a credit union can give somebody a credit card. This is a card somebody can use when they are buying something instead of using cash. Credit cards are given on the trust they will pay the bank or credit union.
