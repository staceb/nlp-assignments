Worcester College, Oxford

Worcester College is one of the colleges of the University of Oxford. It was founded in 1714. The college is located on the site of Gloucester College, which was founded in 1283 as place of study by a Benedictine Abbey. Eventually fifteen abbeys shared the college. In 1539 the abbeys were dissolved. For a time, the college served as the palace of the bishop of Oxford. In 1560, the buildings were purchased by Thomas White, and became known as Gloucester Hall. Some of the original buildings survive today.
