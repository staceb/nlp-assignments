Ed Walker (radio personality)

Ed Walker (April 23, 1932 – October 26, 2015) was an American radio personality from Washington, D.C.. He hosted a weekly four-hour Sunday night program, "The Big Broadcast", on WAMU-FM, featuring vintage radio programs from the 1930s to 1950s, such as "Gunsmoke", "The Jack Benny Show", "The Lone Ranger", "Fibber McGee and Molly", and "Superman". 

Walker began hosting "The Big Broadcast" in 1990 when his friend John Hickman retired hosting due to illness. The show, which started in 1964 as "Recollections", has been the longest running program on WAMU. The show ranks first in its timeslot, and its audience is "remarkably young for a public radio crowd." Walker was blind. 

Walker died in Rockville, Maryland from cancer, aged 83.
