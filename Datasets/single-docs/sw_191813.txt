Foraging

Foraging is the act of hunting or gathering food. For example, cattle forage grass to eat. The idea of animals foraging is called "forage theory", and was first proposed in 1966.

Humans that forage are often called hunter-gatherers, who find and eat (wild) animals and plants without domestication of them (people who farm plants are not hunter-gatherers, as they have grown them themselves).
