Graduated cylinder

A graduated cylinder (or measuring cylinder) is a piece of laboratory glassware used to measure the volume of liquids. It is used to accurately measure the volume of chemicals for use in reactions. 

Often, the biggest graduated cylinders are made of polyethylene or other stiff plastic, making them lighter and less fragile than glass, but more difficult to sterilize.
