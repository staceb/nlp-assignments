¡Uno!

¡Uno! is the ninth studio album by American punk rock band, Green Day. "¡Uno!" was released on September 21, 2012. It is the first album in the ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, ¡Tré! trilogy.

The album featured the singles "Oh Love", "Kill the DJ", and "Let Yourself Go".

Lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said in February 2012 that the band was in the studio, recording music for the album. He said in a statement, "We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives... This is the best music we've ever written, and the songs just keep coming. Instead of making one album, we are making a three album trilogy. Every song has the power and energy that represents Green Day on all emotional levels. We just can't help ourselves ... We are going epic as fuck!"
