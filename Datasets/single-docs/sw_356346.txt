The Bartons Arms

The Bartons Arms is a pub in the Newton neighborhood of Aston, Birmingham. It is in the country of England.

The pub was built in 1901. It had special walls built that let middle class people drinking in the bar see the working class drinkers on the other side, but the working class drinkers could not see the middle-class people watching them. Laurel and Hardy visited the pub. There are photographs of them serving beer to bar visitors.

The Bartons Arms is in the movie "Felicia's Journey" and a book, "The Last Viking: The Untold Story of the World's Greatest Heist," by Ron Dawson. In 2006 the pub had a fire due to electrical problems. In the 2011 England riots the pub was attacked.
