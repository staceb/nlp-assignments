The "L. umbrinum" has a fruiting body, which is shaped like the top of a pear, with a short, slightly buried stipe. It is tall and broad. The fruiting body starts as pale, then goes reddish then to a blackish brown. The outer wall has slender, persistent spines, which are up to 1 mm long. The spores are roughly sspherical, and about 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter, with fine warts and a pedicel that is 0.5–15 µm long. It is uncommonly found, although most often found in coniferous woods on sandy soils.
