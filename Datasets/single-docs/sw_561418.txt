Protests against Donald Trump

Protests against Donald Trump occurred in the United States in 2016. They occurred because of Trump's presidential campaign, and because of the results of the 2016 presidential election.

During Trump's presidential campaign, activists organized demonstrations inside Trump rallies who sometimes called for the rallies to be shut down.

After Trump won the presidential election, students and activists made larger protests in several major cities across the United States. The protesters chanted that Trump is "Not my President!" and other slogans.
