Anubias gilletii

Anubias gilletii is a plant in the Araceae family. It was first described for science in 1901 by Émile Auguste Joseph De Wildeman and Th. Durand.

The plant is found in Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of the Congo, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The plant's leaves are medium-green and spear-shaped. They grow on long stalks. They may grow to about in length. The plant grows in muddy areas near, or in, streams. Sometimes it even grows completely under water.

This plant grows best when only partly under water and when not crowded by other plants. It needs a lot of nutrients. The substrate should be loose and have a lot of iron. The light should be moderate to strong. It prefers a temperature range of 22-26 degrees C (72-79 degrees F). It can be propagated by dividing the stolon or by its seed.
