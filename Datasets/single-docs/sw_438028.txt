Deaerator

A deaerator is a device used to remove dissolved gasses from water. The water will be used as feedwater to steam boilers. Dissolved gasses such as oxygen can cause heavy damage to the boiler system by creating rust on any metal inside the system. Dissolved carbon dioxide combined with water can cause further corrosion.
