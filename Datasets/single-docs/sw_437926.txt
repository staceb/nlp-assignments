Shirley Temple (cocktail)

A Shirley Temple is a non-alcoholic mixed drink made with ginger ale and a splash of grenadine, mixed with a maraschino cherry. Modern Shirley Temple recipes may substitute lemon-lime soda in part, or in whole, for ginger ale. Shirley Temples are often served to children dining with adults in lieu of real cocktails, as is the similar Roy Rogers.

The cocktail may have been invented in the 1930s by a bartender at Chasen's, a restaurant in Beverly Hills, California, to serve then child actress Shirley Temple (1928–2014). However, other claims to its origin have been made. For the cocktail version of this, Shirley Temple Black (after she got married), replace ginger ale with alcoholic ginger beer, and add dark rum (or white rum and Maraschino liqueur).
