Area code 649

Area code 649 is the local telephone area code of Turks and Caicos Islands. The 649 area code was created during a split from the original Area code 809 area code, which was done in or around May 1997.

Like many Caribbean countries Turks and Caicos Islands uses +1 followed by the area code as the international direct dial phone code.

When in Turks and Caicos Islands, use the seven digits alone. To call from anywhere within North America (the United States, Canada, etc.), simply dial 1(869) followed by the phone number.
