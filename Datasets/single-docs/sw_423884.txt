Hesperides

The Hesperides () are nymphs in Greek mythology. They look after a peaceful garden in the far west of the world. The garden is located near Cyrene (or Benghazi) in Libya or the Atlas Mountains further west. In the Ancient Greek view of the world, this is at the edge of Oceanus, the world-ocean. The nymphs are said to be the daughters of Hesperus.
