Neoclassicism music

Neoclassicism in music was popular in the twentieth-century. Mostly between the two World Wars. This kind of music is when composers try to come back to beautiful ways with the broadly defined way of "classicism", namely order, balance, clarity, economy, and emotions. Neoclassicism had two distinct national lines of development. They were French and German. Neoclassicsim was a beautiful trend rather than a movement. Many composers normally do not think of themselves as "neoclassicists." But some really do have some elements of the style.
