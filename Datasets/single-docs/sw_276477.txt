Layoff

Layoff (also called redundancy in British English 
), is when an employee does not work due to temporary or permanent suspension. There are legal differences from being fired. The meaning of "layoff" has changed over time. It first mean that there would be a temporary interruption at places like factories. In modern times, "laying someone off" is usually permanent, although in some special cases someone can be laid off temporarily.
