Antonietta Dell'Era

Antonietta Dell'Era (16 February 1861 Milan 22 June 1945 Berlin) was an Italian "prima ballerina" in Berlin, best remembered for creating the Sugar Plum Fairy in "The Nutcracker" (1892). Her first performance was sold out, and she received good reviews. Modest Tchaikovsky described her as "pudgy and unattractive".
