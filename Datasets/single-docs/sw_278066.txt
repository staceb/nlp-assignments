Beeswax

Beeswax is a wax used by honeybees for building their hive. It is also used in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industry. Large amounts of beeswax are used to make candles. It only has a minor role in the chemical industry, to make ski wax, for example. Sweets which are made of gelatin sometimes use beeswax as a covering. In medicine and physical therapy, beeswax is sometimes used to treat a cough and common cold, as well as muscle pain.
