British Rail Class 800

The British Rail Class 800 "Hitachi Super Express" is a new train built by Hitachi to replace old InterCity 125 and InterCity 225. The class 800 will use diesel fuel and electricity. The 801 trains will be electric-only. The trains can run at a speed of 125mph (200kmph). They can reduce the travel time between London, Leeds, Newcastle and Edinburgh by as much as 18 minutes. One train, a test version of the Hitachi Class 800 Super Express, has arrived from Japan. A new Manufacturing plant will produce 122 trains in the coming years. It will create 730 new jobs. In 2017 the first trains will run on the Great Western Railway main line. In 2018 they will run on the East Coast Main Line.
