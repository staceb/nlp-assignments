French First Republic

The French First Republic was formed on 22 September 1792, by the newly made National Convention. The First Republic lasted until the First French Empire in 1804 under Napoleon I. This time is characterized by the fall of the monarchy, the making of the National Convention and the infamous Reign of Terror, the founding of the Directory and the Thermidorian Reaction, and finally, the making of the Consulate and Napoleon’s rise to power.
