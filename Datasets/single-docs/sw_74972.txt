Abu Talib

Abū Ṭālib ibn ‘Abd al-Muṭṭalib (; –), "né" ‘Imran ) or ‘Abd Manaf (), was the leader of Banu Hashim, a clan of the Qurayshi tribe of Mecca in the Hejaz, Arabian Peninsula. After the death of his father ‘Abd al-Muttalib, he got this position and the offices of "Siqaya" and "Rifada". He was well respected in Mecca even though he was not very rich.

Abu Talib was an uncle of the Islamic "Nabi" (, Prophet) Muhammad, and father of the Rashid Caliph ‘Ali, who is also thought as the first Shi'ite Imam. There is a great debate among Muslim scholars on whether Abū Ṭālib died a Muslim or a non-Muslim.

Abū Ṭālib died around 619, at more than 80 years of age, about 10 years after the start of Muhammad's mission. This year is known as the Year of Sorrow for Muhammad, because not only did his uncle Abu Talib die, but also his wife Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, within a month of Abu Talib.
