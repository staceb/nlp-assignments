Bourbon whiskey

Bourbon is a whiskey that is distilled from grain mash containing at least 51% corn and aged a minimum of two years. It gets its name from Bourbon, Kentucky where most bourbon is produced. Many bourbons are made using a method called "sour mash" where fermentation of each new batch contains a little of the batch before to achieve a consistent quality.

Drinks made from bourbon include Lynchburg Lemonade, Manhattan, and Old Fashioned.
