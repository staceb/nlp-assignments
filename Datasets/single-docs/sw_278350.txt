Galmudug

Galmudug is a secular state in the central region of Somalia. The administrative capital is South Galcayo. It is in the southern half of the city and district of Gaalkacyo. To the north is Puntland, to the west is Ethiopia and to the south and east is the rest of Somalia, presently under the control of the Transitional Federal Government (TFG). The name is a combination of Galguduud and Mudug. Unlike the Somaliland region in northwestern Somalia, Galmudug is not trying to be accepted as a separate country. It believes itself to be a federal division within the larger federal republic of Somalia, such as defined by the 2004 Transitional Federal Charter (TFG).
