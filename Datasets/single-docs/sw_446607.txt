Bittern

Bitterns are waterbirds, living mostly in freshwater sites. They are a type of heron, wading birds in the family Ardeidae. They are shorter-necked, and more secretive than other herons. Most of them have good camouflage amongst the reeds where they make their nests.

Bitterns form a monophyletic subfamily of the herons, the Botaurinae.

Bitterns usually frequent reedbeds and similar marshy areas, and feed on amphibians, reptiles, insects, and fish. Unlike the similar storks, ibises, and spoonbills, herons and bitterns fly with their necks retracted, not outstretched.

They were called "hæferblæte" in Old English; the word "bittern" came to English from Old French. 

Bitterns are in three genera. The genus "Ixobrychus" contains mainly small species. The genus "Botaurus" has the larger bitterns. There is a single species in a third genus, "Zebrilus". The distribution of bitterns is pretty much worldwide.
