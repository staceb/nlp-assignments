Formicariidae

The Formicariidae or ground antbirds are a family of small passerine birds. They live in subtropical and tropical Central and South America. They are between 10 and 20 cm (4–8 in) in length.

These are forest birds that tend to eat insects at or near the ground. Many are specialist ant eaters. Note that the term "antbird" is for another family of birds, the Thamnophilidae.
