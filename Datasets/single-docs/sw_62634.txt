Antichrist

In Christian beliefs, the Antichrist or Anti-christ ("anti" means opposite; "christ" means messiah) is used to speak about a person or image that implies evil, and more than one person. It is also said that antichrist is the devil himself.

The Biblical Book of Revelation refers to two "Beasts". One of them is often identified as the Antichrist, the counter-messiah of the devil.
