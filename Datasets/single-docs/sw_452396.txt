Amplituhedron

An amplituhedron is a geometric shape that makes it easier to calculate particle interactions in quantum field theories.

Currently, the limits of the "N" = 4 supersymmetric Yang–Mills theory, which is used to calculate the amplituhedron, cause it to be a toy theory. Therefore, the application of the amplituhedron is limited in the real world.
