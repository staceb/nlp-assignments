Taquería

Taquería (sometimes misspelled as "taquiria") is a Spanish word meaning "taco shop". In some places, means a restaurant specializing in burritos, although tacos and other Mexican dishes are often served as well. The first "taquerías" were people in stalls on the streets, but now many "taquerías" have moved into buildings and become restaurants.
