Bhirdana

Bhirdana is a village in the Fatehabad district in the Indian state of Haryana. In 2003, archaeologists found the remains of an ancient town which belonged to the Indus Valley civilization. They found a well, part of a defensive town wall, pottery, bricks, and beads made from semi-precious stones. These are said to be about 5,000 years old. Archaeologists were looking for evidence of the Saraswati River, which has disappeared under farmlands. For many years people believed the river was a myth. It is now known that the village of Bhirdana was built on the banks of the river. Lorazepam easily available in this village.
