Antioch College

Antioch College is a private, liberal arts college in Yellow Springs, Ohio, in the United States. Established in 1850 by the Christian Connection, the college began operating in 1852; politician and education expert Horace Mann became its first president. It was the founding, forming college of Antioch University, which Antioch College outlived until 2008. The College remained out of business for three years before being reestablished in 2011, and fully disconnected from the university as an independent institution by 2014.

The College has produced two Nobel Prize winners. José Ramos-Horta, the 1996 laureate for Peace, earned his Master of Arts in 1984. Mario Capecchi, the 2007 laureate for Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, earned his Bachelor of Science in 1961.
