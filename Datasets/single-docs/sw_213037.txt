Hunza (princely state)

Hunza () was a former princely state in the northernmost part of the Northern Areas, of Pakistan, which existed until 1974. The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south, the former princely state of Nagar to the east, Chinese Turkistan to the north and Afghanistan to the northwest. The state capital was the town of Baltit (also known as Karimabad). The area of Hunza now forms the Aliabad Tehsil of Hunza-Nagar District.
