My Plague

"My Plague" is the third single off American metal band Slipknot's second studio album "Iowa". The song was released on July 8, 2002. 

There was a remix for the song called "New Abuse Mix" that was featured on the soundtrack to the 2002 movie "Resident Evil". the remix cut a screamed layer of vocals and replaced it with a more monotone, drone-like sounding layer. The new version was cut by approximately 00:37 seconds by removing the transitional ""Kill you, fuck you, I will never be you"" section. Some of the profanities were also replaced with less offensive phrases; like the phrase ""...the everyday bullshit things that you have done"" was changed to, ""...the everyday abusive things that you have done"" and ""You fucking touch me, I will rip you apart..."" was replaced with ""...and if you touch me, I will rip you apart..."". The whole second verse of the chorus was removed.

In 2003, the song was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Metal Performance category but it lost to Korn's "Here to Stay".
