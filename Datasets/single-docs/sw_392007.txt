Canton (country subdivision)

A canton is a type of administrative division of a country. Generally, cantons have fewer people and are smaller than other administrative divisions like counties, departments, or provinces. 

Cantons exist in many countries. The best-known cantons and the most politically important are those of Switzerland. The Swiss cantons are semi-sovereign.
