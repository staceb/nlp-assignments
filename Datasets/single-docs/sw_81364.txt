Camptosaurus

Camptosaurus (meaning "bent lizard") was a plant-eater from the Upper Jurassic (about 156 to 145 million years ago). It is related to Iguanodon. 

It was a heavy ornithischian dinosaur that was about 16-23 feet (5-7 m) long and 3-4 feet (1 m) high at the hips, weighing roughly 2,200 pounds (1000 kg). It had a long snout, hundreds of teeth and a horny beak. Its legs were longer than its arms; it had four-toed feet and five-fingered arms, all with hooves. It could walk on two or four legs, it probably went on all four to graze for low-lying plants.
