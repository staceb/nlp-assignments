Chocolate chip

Chocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate. They are used to make desserts, usually in baking. Chocolate chips are most common in cookies. Chocolate chips are also used in some cakes and other desserts.

Chocolate chips were invented in 1937 when Ruth Graves Wakefield of the Toll House Inn added cut-up chunks of a semi-sweet Nestlé chocolate bar to a cookie recipe. Lots of people liked the new cookies, and Wakefield made an agreement in 1939 with Nestlé to put her recipe on the chocolate bar's packaging. In return, Nestlé gave Wakefield a lifetime supply of chocolate. At first, Nestlé put a small chopping tool in the chocolate bar package. In 1941 Nestlé and one or more other chocolate bar companies started selling the chocolate in chip (or "morsel") form. The Nestlé brand Toll House cookies is named after Toll House Inn.
