Nashville Predators

The Nashville Predators are a professional ice hockey team based in Nashville, Tennessee. They play in the National Hockey League (NHL). Their name is sometimes shortened to the "Preds." They play in Bridgestone Arena (formerly named "Nashville Arena", "Gaylord Entertainment Center", and "Sommet Center"). Their logo is a reference to a partial Smilodon skeleton that was found beneath downtown Nashville in 1971, during the construction of the First American National Bank. The franchise held a vote with the fans to choose a team name. The three candidates that were chosen were: The Ice Tigers, Fury, and Attack. Another choice, Predators, was added to the vote. Predators won the vote, and the new franchise was named the Nashville Predators.
