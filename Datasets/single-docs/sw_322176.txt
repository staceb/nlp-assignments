Travis Lane Stork

Travis Lane Stork, MD (born March 9, 1972, in Fort Collins, Colorado) is an American emergency physician and television personality. He is best known for being "The Bachelor", and as the host of the syndicated daytime talk show, "The Doctors".

Stork graduated "magna cum laude" from Duke University, and earned his M.D. from the University of Virginia. He completed his emergency medicine residency at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Before returning to Vanderbilt as a faculty physician, he worked as an attending physician in a private hospital system in Colorado. Dr. Stork currently splits his time between Nashville and Los Angeles, where he hosts the syndicated television show "The Doctors".

While Stork was finishing his residency program, he met the producers of "The Bachelor" by chance. They invited him to interview for the show. In 2006, Stork was the bachelor during season 8 of "The Bachelor." During the season finale of the show, Stork chose school teacher, Sarah Stone, who coincidentally lived only a few blocks away from his residence. He proposed a relationship instead of marriage. After the series ended, they broke up. In May 2011 Travis got engaged to his girlfriend of two years, Dr. Charlotte Brown, a Nashville native.

In 2007 Stork was selected to serve as the lead host on "The Doctors", a Los Angeles-based daytime medical/talk show, produced by Jay McGraw, son of Dr. Phil McGraw, which debuted in September 2008. On the show, Stork heads a panel of three other physicians from different fields (pediatrics, plastic surgery and obstetrics) as they discuss health issues and answer audience questions. The idea came about from a series of "Dr. Phil" show segments. Stork has been a frequent contributor on "Dr. Phil".
