Upsilon Andromedae d

Upsilon Andromedae d is an extrasolar planet. It orbits the Sun-like star Upsilon Andromedae A. 

Upsilon Andromedae A was the third star known to host a multiple-planet planetary system, the others are the Sun and the pulsar PSR 1257+12. 

In 1999, two groups of astronomers independently concluded that a three-planet model best fit the data. The two new planets were designated Upsilon Andromedae C and Upsilon Andromedae D.
