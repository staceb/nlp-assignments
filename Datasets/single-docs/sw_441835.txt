Three Dollar Bill, Y'all

Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$ is the debut studio album by American nu metal band, Limp Bizkit. "Three Dollar Bill, Y'all$" was released on July 1, 1997. 

The album featured the singles "Counterfeit", "Sour", and a cover of George Michaels' song "Faith". Guitarist Wes Borland said in an interview that George Michael hated Limp Bizkit's cover and "hates us for doing it".

The album had attracted controversy when Interscope Records paid a Portland, Oregon radio station $5,000 to play the single "Counterfeit" fifty times which attracted criticism of "payola" toward both the band and the label.
