South Thailand insurgency

The insurgency in Southern Thailand is a violent rebellion that is taking place in three southern provinces of Thailand. There are Naratiwat Pattani, and Yala. Most of the people that live in these provinces are not related to Thai people. They are Muslim Malays.

The rebellion started in the 19th century, when the British and the King of Siam agreed on the border between Siam and Malaya. The British took Kedah and Kelantan, and Pattani became part of Siam. The sultan of Pattani was removed and his kingdom was split into three provinces. Ever since then, the Malay people of this region have wanted to get their independence back, or to join Malaysia as a state.

The unrest in the southern provinces is one of the biggest problems in Thailand. There is an armed struggle against the government. There are many severe attacks on civilians too, mostly considered terrorism. Since it has happened, some Thai families had to move out from the site because the problems changed their lives. They were also scared of what would happen with them.
