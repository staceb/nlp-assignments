Red Star OS

Red Star OS is the operating system used by computers in North Korea. The latest version of the operating system is Red Star 3 and it looks almost exactly like macOS. Before Red Star 3 came out, Red Star looked more like Windows instead of macOS. Red Star OS also has its very own web browser called Naenara which means "my country" in Korean. It has a modified version of Mozilla Firefox and it has the North Korean internet called Kwangmyong.
