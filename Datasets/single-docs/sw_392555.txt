Indigenous Protected Area

An Indigenous Protected Area, or IPA, is an area of land or sea owned by the Indigenous peoples of Australia. In an IPA the owners have made an agreement with the Australian Government to protect biodiversity and cultural resources.

There are over 50 IPAs covering an area of more than 36 million hectares. It is planned to increase this area by another 8 million hectares by 2018. In July 2012, the southern Tanami Indigenous Protected Area was declared, covering 10 million hectares in the Northern Territory. This is the traditional home of the Warlpairi, and includes the communities of Yuendumu, Willowra and Nyrripi.

Each IPA is managed by its traditional owners. Plants, animals and cultural sites are protected. The owners work with the government to control weeds, feral animals, bushfires, and visitors.
