Ontario Highway 24

Ontario Highway 24 is a provincial highway in Ontario, Canada. It runs from south to north. It starts at Highway 3 in Norfolk County and ends in Collingwood, near the southern part of Cambridge. There are many accidents on the part of the highway between Brantford and Collingwood, where Highway 403 connects with Highway 24. This area can become extremely busy at times. This problem has become so bad that the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario is trying to decide how to improve Highway 24 at this part.
