In the year 1941 on Yom Kippur, the rabbi's important library was destroyed by local Iron Guard gangsters. He was treated badly and was asked to sign a document which says that he had hidden dynamite in the synagogue to be used for sabotage.

All the synagogues in the city were robbed of their valuables.
