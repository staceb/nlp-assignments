MTOR

mTOR is a protein, an enzyme which regulates cell growth, cell division, cell movement, cell survival, protein synthesis, autophagy, and transcription. It is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "MTOR" gene.

It has been given various names. It was originally called the 'mammalian target of rapamycin', but is also known as the 'mechanistic target of rapamycin' and 'FK506-binding protein 12-rapamycin-associated protein 1' (FRAP1).

The mTOR pathway is a central regulator of mammalian metabolism and physiology, with important roles in the function of tissues including liver, muscle, white and brown adipose tissue, and the brain.
