Cam Cameron

Cam Cameron is an American Football coach who is currently the offensive coodinator of the Baltimore Ravens. He was the head coach for the Miami Dolphins in 2007, but was fired after a 1-15 season. Cameron has been heavily criticized for his conservative (safe) play-calling.

Cameron spent time as a college football assistant. He was also the head coach of Indiana University's football team. 

Cameron spent some time as the Washington Redskins's quarterbacks coach. He was later promoted to the offensive coodinator position of the San Diego Chargers, where he helped guide future-star quarterback Drew Brees.

Cameron was hired as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins before the 2007 season. However, the franchise had its worst ever season and finished 1-15. He had an overtime victory against the Baltimore Ravens, coincidentally Cameron's next team. Cameron was replaced by Tony Sparano.

During a Baltimore Ravens roster and coaching overall, John Harbaugh hired Cameron as the new Baltimore offensive coodinator. In 2008, Cameron worked on the Suggs package, a play-calling that would have both quarterbacks Joe Flacco and Troy Smith. Following 2008, Cameron was criticized heavily for his conservative (safe) play-calling. After his contract expired following the 2011 season, Harbaugh announced that Cameron would in fact be back.
