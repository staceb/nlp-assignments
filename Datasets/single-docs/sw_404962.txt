Wrestling Brewster

Wrestling Brewster (ca. 1614 - ?) was a passenger on the ship "Mayflower" in 1620 when it sailed from England to North America. He was born in Leiden, The Netherlands about 1614 to William and Mary Brewster. He was alive during the 1627 Division of Cattle at Plymouth, and was listed in his father's household at that time. He is not mentioned again in any record, or in his father's will of 1644, or in the inventory of his father's estate. He did not marry. It is probable that he died some time between 1627 and 1644.
