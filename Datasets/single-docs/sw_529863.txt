Front-runner

In American politics, a front-runner or "'frontrunner" is a leader/most popular in an electoral race.

A political front-runner, mainly during the U.S. presidential primary process, is the most likely to be the nominee or the one who leads in the polls. The front-runner is most often declared by the media who are following the race, and is written about in a different style than his or her challengers.
