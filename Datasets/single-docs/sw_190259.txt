Firmin Abauzit

Firmin Abauzit (1679 – 1767) was a French scientist who is well known because he read and corrected Issac Newtons work on gravity.

King of England William III asked Abauzit if he would like to stay in England, but he declined and returned to Geneva, where he took a role as Librarian. He lived in Geneva for the next 40 years until his death at age 87 in 1767.
