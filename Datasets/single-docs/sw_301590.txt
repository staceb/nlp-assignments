A Serbian Film

A Serbian Film is a horror movie which opened to much controversy. When it was released during 2010, the movie was marked with a Refused Classification rating in Australia. A highly censored version was later approved. It was released in the United States with a rating of NC-17 (No Children 17 or Under Admitted) in May 2011. The movie is about a pornographic movie star who agrees to perform in an art film, but then learns that he has been dragged into a snuff movie filled with necrophilia and other adult themes. "A Serbian Film" faced severe censorship problems in many countries because of its mature content.
