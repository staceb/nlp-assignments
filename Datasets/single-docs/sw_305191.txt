Sprawl trilogy

The "Sprawl" trilogy is William Gibson's first set of novels. The three books in the series are: "Neuromancer" (1984), "Count Zero" (1986), and "Mona Lisa Overdrive" (1988). It is also called the Neuromancer, Cyberspace, or Matrix trilogy. "The Sprawl" is a name for a very large city in the novels.

The stories all happen in the same fictional future. The books share characters and themes. Some of Gibson's short stories "Johnny Mnemonic," "New Rose Hotel," and "Burning Chrome" also happen in the Sprawl.
