Marzipan

Marzipan is a confection often used in sweets and cakes. 

It is made of sugar or honey and crushed almonds ('almond meal'). Sometimes almond oil or extract is added. It is made into sweets, and rolled into thin sheets for putting round cakes. The sweets are marzipan-filled chocolate and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables. Used as a covering for cakes, it is glazed. Glazing is a cooking technique which make it harder, and avoid unsightly damage.
