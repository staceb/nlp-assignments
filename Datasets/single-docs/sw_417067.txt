Konzertstück in F minor

Concert Piece (Konzertstück) in F minor for Piano and Orchestra, Op. 79, J. 282 is a piece of music for piano and orchestra. It was written by Carl Maria von Weber, and first performed on June 25, 1821 in Berlin, Germany. 

It is one unbroken piece of music with four sections in different tempos. Weber wrote a program for the piece. It tells of a lady and her knight. They are separated by war, but are happily reunited by the end of the music. Mendelssohn played the piece in a concert when he was 18 years old. Liszt and Stravinsky were both influenced by the piece when writing similar works of their own.
