Lingerie

Lingerie is a term for women's underclothes. In advertising, it suggests fashionable and alluring undergarments. Materials include silk, cotton, polyester, satin, nylon and lace.

The 20th century brought big changes in women's underwear. The idea of lingerie as a visually appealing undergarment was developed in the late nineteenth century by Lady Duff-Gordon of 'Lucile'. She was a pioneer in developing lingerie that freed women from more restrictive corsets.

The word "lingerie" comes from "linge", meaning 'washables' in French. "Faire le linge" is "do the laundry" in French.

Brassieres (aka bras), knickers and negligees are basic examples of female lingerie.
