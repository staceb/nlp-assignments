Cornellà

Cornellà de Llobregat is a municipality in the comarca of the Baix Llobregat in Catalonia, Spain. It is situated on the left of the Llobregat river.

The history of Cornellà de Llobregat is defined by three principal factors: its proximity to the city of Barcelona, its being an area of passage from the capital of Catalonia, and the presence of the Llobregat River. Its name is of Roman origin (Cornelianus) and the first written reference to the city dates from 980 AD, although the city was incorporated into Barcelona's territory in the thirteenth century.
