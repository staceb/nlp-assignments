Cinderella (ballet)

Cinderella, Op. 87 is a ballet. The scenario by Nikolai Volkov was based on the 1697 fairy tale "Cendrillon" by Charles Perrault. The music was composed by Sergei Prokofiev between 1940 and 1944. The premiere of "Cinderella" was conducted by Yuri Fayer on November 21, 1945, at the Bolshoi Theatre. The choreography was composed by Rostislav Zakharov. Galina Ulanova danced the title role. Three orchestral suites were extracted from the ballet, and three collections of piano arrangements.

Cinderella lives with her wicked stepsisters. A beggar (who reveals herself to be a fairy) rewards Cinderella by giving her a coach and a new look. At the royal ball, Cinderella falls in love with the prince. She stays only until midnight when the spell wears off. She leaves her slipper behind. The prince uses it to find her again.
