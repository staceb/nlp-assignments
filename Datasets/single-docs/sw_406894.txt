Specific phobia

Specific phobias are a generic form of anxiety condition which consists of unreasonable or irrational fears of exposure to specific objects or certain situations. Affected people tend to avoid direct contact with such objects or situations, sometimes even the mentions of them. Exposure may result in panic attacks or severe anxiety. The usual onset age is childhood or adolescence, although the condition can start for young adults. Females are almost twice as likely to suffer from specific phobias as males. Examples for specific phobia include fears of thunderstorms and certain animals, particularly spiders or snakes.
