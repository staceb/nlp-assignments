Funeral march

A funeral march ("Marche funèbre", "Trauermarsch") is a march, usually in a minor key, in a slow "simple duple" metre, creating the solemn pace of a funeral procession. Some such marches are often considered appropriate for use during funerals and other occasions, the most well-known being the third movement of Piano Sonata No. 2 by Frédéric Chopin. Handel uses the name dead march, also used for marches played by a military band at military funerals and executions.
