Metis (moon)

Metis or , is Jupiter's closest moon.

Metis was found in 1979 by Stephen P. Synnott in images taken by the Voyager 1 probe. Its designation was . In 1983 it was named after the mythological Metis, a Titaness who was the first wife of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of Jupiter).

Metis not a sphere and measures 60×40×34 km across. The composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86 g/cm³), its mass can be estimated as ~7×10 kg. Amalthea's density implies that moon is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10-15%, and Adrastea may be similar.

The surface of Metis is very cratered. It is dark and appears to be reddish in color.

Metis is the closest moon to Jupiter. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of ~1269,000 km. It has a very small orbital eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.

The images taken by "Voyager 1" showed Metis only as a dot, and very little was known about Metis until the arrival of the "Galileo" spacecraft. "Galileo" took pictures of almost all of the surface of Metis and put constraints on its composition.
