Flag of Antigua and Barbuda

The national flag of Antigua and Barbuda was started on February 27, 1967. It was designed by artist and sculptor, Sir Reginald Samuel. The rising sun is for the dawning of a new era. The colours have different meanings. The black is for the African ancestry of the people. The blue is for hope. The red is for energy or dynamism of the people. The colouring of yellow, blue, and white (from the sun down) is for the sun, sea, and sand. The blue also is for the Caribbean Sea. The V-shape is the symbol of victory.
