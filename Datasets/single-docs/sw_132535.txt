Paprika

Paprika is a spice made from the grinding of dried sweet red bell peppers. The word comes from a Serbian word meaning "pepper". In many non-English speaking European countries, the word "paprika" also refers to bell peppers themselves. The seasoning is used in many cuisines to add color and flavor to cooked foods.
