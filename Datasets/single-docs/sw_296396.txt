Brief psychotic disorder

Brief psychotic disorder is a short illness of less than one month that has psychotic symptoms. This could be like having schizophrenia symptoms for only an hour, but it can be any psychotic disorder, such as delusions or hallucinations. Doctors describe three types of BPD. The first type is caused by some kind of traumatic stress. The second type has no known cause. Some psychologists believe it could be from stimulants such as caffeine, morphine or any type of drug. There is no known cure but staying away from caffeinated drinking may lower the risk of brief psychotic disorder. The third type is caused by childbirth and usually affects mothers about four weeks after having a baby.
