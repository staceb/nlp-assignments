Sunshine Skyway Bridge

Sunshine Skyway Bridge is a highway bridge in Tampa Bay, Florida, that crosses 29,040 feet (5.5 miles or about 8.85 km). Every day, about 50,500 vehicles (cars and trucks) cross over the bridge. The bridge is considered Florida's ""flag bridge"" (Florida's most important bridge). On May 9, 1980, a freighter ship, called the MV "Summit Venture", ran into one of the bridge's supporting columns. 1200 feet (366 meters) of the bridge fell into the water, and 35 people were killed. The bridge was reconstructed to its current version in 1987.
