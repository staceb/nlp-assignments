Kottabos (Kleophrades Painter)

Kottabos Player is an Attic red-figure terracotta kylix said to have been painted by someone close to the Kleophrades Painter. It dates to the Greek Archaic period, about 500 BC. The kylix's height with handles is 3 3/16 in. (8.1 cm) and its width with handles is 10 1/16 in. (25.5 cm). The diameter of the bowl is 7 5/8 in. (19.3 cm). The kylix is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. The figure is a symposiast playing a party game called kottabos. He is about to fling the last of the wine in his cup at a lamp stand in an attempt to knock the lamp stand's finial off. The winner was he who did so.
