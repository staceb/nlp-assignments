Google Books

Google Books is a website run by Google. It lets you search and browse books and magazines that have been scanned in. The text of the books has been made searchable using optical character recognition (OCR). The site has been known under different names including Google Print and Google Book Search. It was announced and launched in 2004.

In 2005, book publishers sued Google for "massive copyright infringement" for scanning books without permission. Google claimed that this was fair use. Google has been sued in a number of countries over copyright issues related to Google Books.
