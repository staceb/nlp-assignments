Hillsborough Stadium

Hillsborough Stadium is the home of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club in Sheffield, England. It was opened on 2 September 1899. It is now a 39,814 capacity all-seater stadium. A lot of the seats are covered. It is located in the Sheffield suburb of Owlerton. It takes its name from the parliamentary constituency in which it is.

On 15 April 1989, the ground was the scene of one of the worst sporting tragedies of all time. 94 Liverpool fans were crushed to death in an FA Cup semi-final. This was called the Hillsborough disaster. The final death toll was 96. This meant that extra security measures were added there and in other stadiums around the country.
