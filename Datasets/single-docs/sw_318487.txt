Multiplayer online game

A Multiplayer Online Game is a multiplayer video game which can be played over the internet, with other players around the world. Some examples of this are "Battlefield 2", "Halo 3", "Counter-Strike", "Quake 3", "StarCraft", "", "NBA 2K11", and the Sega Meganet.

These games are different from MMORPGs because they do not create a persistent world, but create a playing arena for the purpose of a single game or round.
