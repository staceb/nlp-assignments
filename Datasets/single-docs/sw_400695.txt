Bridal Chorus

The "Bridal Chorus" is a piece of music from Richard Wagner's opera "Lohengrin" (1850). Transcriptions of the piece for pipe organ or other instruments are sometimes used at western world weddings as the bride enters the wedding site. The piece is slow and solemn. It is sometimes called the Wedding March or the Bridal March.
