Corps

A corps is a military unit usually made up of two or more divisions. In the United States Army, a corps is the largest tactical unit that can plan and carry out its own missions. The term can also be applied to a military unit with a specific function such as a Quartermaster Corps or an Intelligence Corps. It can be applied to a branch of a military such as the United States Marine Corps. It can also mean a body of officers such as a Cadet Corps. The word has other uses. A group of people engaged in the same work can be called a corps. An example is the Peace Corps. The word comes from the Old French "cors" meaning "body, person, corpse, life". That word, in turn, is based on the Latin word "corpus" meaning "body".
