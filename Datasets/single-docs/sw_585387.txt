Quezon Avenue

Quezon Avenue is an important road in the area of Metro Manila in the Philippines. With 6 to 14 lanes (3 to 7 lanes for each direction), it measures 7.1 kilometers (4.4 miles) long. It starts at the ellipse-shaped Quezon Memorial Circle in Quezon City and ends at the circle-shaped Welcome Rotunda at the border between Quezon City and Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Along the way, it meets Epifanio de los Santos Avenue and Gregorio Araneta Avenue. It is considered by most drivers as one of the most comfortable roads of Quezon City.

Quezon Avenue is named after Manuel L. Quezon, the second president of the Philippines. It was formerly known as Don Mariano Marcos Avenue, after Mariano Marcos, the father of President Ferdinand Marcos. The road was built in the mid-1970s, during Marcos' time as the president of the country. Its name was changed to Quezon Avenue shortly after Marcos's presidency.
