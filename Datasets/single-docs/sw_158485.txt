Wind farm

A wind farm is a group of wind turbines in the same area. These turbines turn moving air into electricity. A large wind farm has several hundred wind turbines, and covers an area of hundreds of square miles. A wind farm may also be offshore.

Many of the biggest onshore wind farms are in the USA. The Roscoe Wind Farm is the largest onshore wind farm in the world, producing 781.5 MW of power, followed by the Horse Hollow Wind Energy Center (735.5 MW). The Thanet Offshore Wind Project in United Kingdom is the largest offshore wind farm in the world at 300 MW, followed by Horns Rev II (209 MW) in Denmark.
