Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25

The MiG-25 Foxbat is a fast fighter plane made made by Russian airplane company Mikoyan. Its primary goal is to attack enemies at high speed and altitude. It first flew in 1964 and was introduced in 1970. In 1976, a Soviet MiG-25 pilot left the Soviet Union and flew his plane to Japan, where it was looked at. It is very fast, and can go Mach 3.2 (3.2 times the speed of sound). However, the engines could be destroyed if the plane is flown this fast. It can carry 4 radar guided missiles and 4 heat seeking missiles. It is now being replaced by the MiG-31 Foxhound, but is used a little in other countries.
