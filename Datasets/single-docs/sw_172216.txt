Powell's Books

Powell's Books is a bookstore in Portland, Oregon, United States. It has seven locations. It says it is the world's largest independent new and used bookstore in the world with more than one million (1,000,000) books on its shelves. The main store covers an entire city block between West Burnside Street, NW Couch Street, NW 10th and 11th avenues.

The bookstore began in 1971.
In 2002, "USA Today" said Powell's was one of America's ten best bookstores.

Powell's wants to add as much as two floors to the store's southeast corner—at least . The plan was submitted to the City of Portland to be approved in November 2008.
