Trento Longaretti

Trento Longaretti (29 March 1917 – 7 June 2017) was an Italian painter. He studied at the Brera Academy in the 1930s, where he was taught by renowned artists including painters Aldo Carpi and Pompeo Borra, and sculptors Francesco Messina and Marino Marini. 

Longaretti stated that painting is an "elixir for long life", and continued to paint and exhibit as a centenarian.

His oil paintings have been described as dense and oily like those of Paul Cézanne, and his style having similarities to the fantasy settings of Marc Chagall and "pictorial culture" of Egon Schiele. His still life paintings have been described as "delicate and almost religious".

He became involved in the Italian figurative art movement of the 1950s.

He turned 100 in March 2017 and died on 7 June 2017.
