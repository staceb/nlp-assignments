Electrolyte

An electrolyte is a chemical that conducts electrical current. It is used in batteries to make the ions flow, producing current. Electrolytes ionize when dissolved in suitable solvents such as water. Most soluble salts, acids, and bases are electrolytes. 

An electrolyte used in "electrolytic cells" carries the ions between the electrodes of the cell. Electrolytic cells may be used to extract constituent elements and compounds contained in the solution.

A correct concentration of electrolytes is important to physiology.
