Levi Boone

Levi Day Boone (December 6, 1808 – January 24, 1882) served as mayor of Chicago, Illinois (1855–1856) for the American Party (Know-Nothings).

Boone was born near Lexington, Kentucky. He studied at Transylvania University. He became a doctor. Boone was married to Louise M. Smith. They had 11 children. In 1862, Boone was arrested and briefly held in Camp Douglas on suspicion that he had helped a Confederate prisoner to escape. 

Boone first ran for mayor of Chicago in 1855. He campaigned on a platform attacking Catholics and immigrants. After he was elected, he ordered the enforcement of a law against selling alcohol on Sundays -- but only in immigrant neighborhoods. On April 21, 1854, protesters, who did not like the bars being closed on Sudnays, fought with police, who supported Boone. "One protester was killed and dozens wounded in the brief clash, but the resulting backlash destroyed Boone's political career." Boone did not run for re-election in the mayoral election of 1856. Boone died on January 24, 1882 in Chicago, Illinois, aged 73.
