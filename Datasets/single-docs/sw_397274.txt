ESTCube-1

ESTCube-1 is the first satellite from Estonia. It was made as part of the Estonian Student Satellite Program, and was launched on 7 May 2013 on a Vega rocket. The satellite is a project in which university and high-school students took part. The CubeSat standard for nanosatellites was followed while it was built, resulting in a 10x10x11.35 cm cube, with a volume of 1 liter and a mass of 1.048 kg.

ESTCube-1 was put into orbit by Arianespace, using a Vega rocket which took off from ELA-1 at Kourou at 02:06:31 UTC on 7 May 2013 at a height of 670 kilometres.
