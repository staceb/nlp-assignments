TNT has a history spanning more than 250 years. Its Dutch roots can be traced back to 1752. But it wasn’t until 1946 that the company known as TNT was born, on the other side of the world, in Australia. In the 60 years since then, TNT has grown into a global enterprise, even operating its own aircraft. Much of this growth has come from take-overs and acquisitions. In 1996, TNT was acquired by the Dutch company KPN (formerly PTT Post).

All packages are delivered to a local warehouse. A courier collects the packages from the warehouse and delivers them to the address on the package. Couriers will also collect packages from a certain area and take them to the warehouse where they can be sorted and sent to the warehouse nearest the receiver’s address.

In the United Kingdom, couriers are often part-time workers, delivering packages using their own cars. They collect and deliver packages to any house in a certain postcode area. This way, the TNT company can be sure of delivering to any house in the area.
