The BMO Vancouver Marathon is an annual marathon which is run on the first Sunday of every May in Vancouver, British Columbia. The distance of the race is 26 miles and 385 yards and is the largest international marathon event in Canada. The current sponsor for the marathon is Bank of Montreal.

It is certified by both the International Association of Athletics Federations & Association of International Marathons and Distance Races as a qualifying marathon race.

A Full Marathon is a Boston Marathon qualifying event and is 42 km, and a Half Marathon is 21 km.

The Forbes 2014 Travel Guide named the BMO Vancouver Marathon one of the world’s Top Ten Marathons Worth Travelling For that marathon season. It also made their top ten marathon destinations in 2012.
