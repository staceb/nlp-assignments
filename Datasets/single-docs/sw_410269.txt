Fingerboard

The fingerboard is a part of most stringed instruments, such the guitar and the violin. It is a long strip of material, usually wood, that protrudes from the body of the instrument. Strings are stretched across the length of the fingerboard, raised slightly by the bridge. The player pushes the strings against the fingerboard to create different notes. On some fingerboards, there are ridges called frets. This kind of fingerboard is called a fretboard.

Stickers can be placed on the fingerboard to show the chords for each string. Fret stickers were introduced as a way to help beginners learn to play guitar. They have become helpful for music teachers and professionals in their teachings. Stickers are labeled A-G and can be placed to show notes, chords or scales effectively and efficiently.
