Windows Mail

Windows Mail is an email client included with Windows Vista. It will not be included with any future releases of Windows because of the new Windows Live Mail. It replaced the popular Microsoft Outlook Express email client that was included in Windows 98, ME, 2000 & XP. Unlike Outlook Express, Windows Mail is not included with Windows Internet Explorer.
