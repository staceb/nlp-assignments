Mademoiselle

Mademoiselle was an American fashion magazine which was mostly for women. It was first published in 1935 by Street and Smith. "Mademoiselle" became known for publishing short stories by authors including Tennessee Williams, Truman Capote and James Baldwin. In the 1960s, "Mademoiselle" became a clothing and fashion magazine. When the editors could not update the magazine to appeal to enough people, "Mademoiselle" stopped printing. The last issue was in November 2001. Some employees and features of the magazine were then transferred to the "Glamour" magazine.
