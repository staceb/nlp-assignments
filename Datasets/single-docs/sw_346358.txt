2007 Cricket World Cup

The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup was the ninth edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup tournament. It took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007. It used the sport's One Day International format. There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at the 2003 World Cup.

The 16 competing teams were first divided into four groups. The two best-performing teams from each group moved on to a "Super 8" format. From this, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka and South Africa went to the semi-finals. Australia beat Sri Lanka in the final to win their third consecutive World Cup.
