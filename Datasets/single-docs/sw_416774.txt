Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)

Scheherazade is a piece of music by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It was written for orchestra in 1888. The music was inspired by the Arabian Nights stories. There are four movements: "Sinbad the Sailor"; "The Kalendar Prince"; "The Young Prince and the Young Princess"; and "Festival at Baghdad". Fokine designed a ballet in 1910 for the Ballets Russes using the music.
