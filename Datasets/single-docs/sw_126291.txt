The former subdivisions of Pakistan are states, provinces and territories of Pakistan. Most of which existed between 1947 and 1975.

Pakistan's subdivisions originate from those of British India, during their rule the British had established provinces and chief commissioners. After 1947 Pakistan and India became independent when British India was divided.

From 1947 to 1971, Pakistan was split into two areas (East and West Pakistan) that were 1600 kilometres apart separated by India in the middle. The eastern wing had one province - East Bengal which included the Sylhet District from the former Indian province of Assam, and also the former district of East Pakistan province. The western wing was formed from three Governor's provinces (North-West Frontier Province (NWFP), West Punjab and Sind (historical), one Chief Commissioner's Province (Baluchistan), several Princely states and parts of occupied Kashmir.
