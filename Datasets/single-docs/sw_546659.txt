Monte Vettore

Monte Vettore (; "victorious") is a mountain on the border between Umbria and the Marche, in Central Italy.

It is the highest mountain in the Marche region and in the province of Ascoli Piceno.

The mountain is part of the Sibillini Mountains (), a mountain group in Italy, part of the central Apennines between eastern Umbria and the Marche. It is in the "Sibillini Mountains National Park" ().

Below the peak, in a small enclosed U-shaped valley is one lake called the "Lago di Pilato", at an altitude of . Even if it is a small lake ( in diameter), it is important for biologists; a fresh water shrimp, "Chirocephalus marchesonii", is endemic to this lake.

Today climbers reach it from the Umbrian side from Norcia, a town and "comune" in the province of Perugia (Italy) in southeastern Umbria or, on the Marche side, from Ascoli Piceno.
