Victoria, Hong Kong

Victoria City was one of the first urban settlements in Hong Kong after it became a British colony in 1842. It was named after Queen Victoria, the Queen of the United Kingdom.

In 1857, the British government expanded Victoria City and divided it into seven districts, including Sai Ying Pun, Sheung Wan, Tai Ping Shan and Central. These were located in the area that is now the Central, Western and Wanchai districts.

Victoria City is technically the capital of Hong Kong. However, the name is rarely used today.
