Maxinquaye

Maxinquaye is the first album of the English actor and musician Tricky, released in 1995. Expanding on the music template of fellow Bristolians Massive Attack, and featuring then-girlfriend Martina Topley-Bird on vocals, "Maxinquaye" is a dark, strange album featuring a combination of hip-hop, soul, dub, rock and electronica.

"Maxinquaye", named after Tricky's late mother Maxine Quaye, who died when he was four, received great critical attention upon release. The album was re-issued in the UK on 2 November 2009 by Universal Island with a second disc of remixes as a "Deluxe Edition".
