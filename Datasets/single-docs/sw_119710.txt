Bigpoint GmbH

Bigpoint GmbH is a game developer based in Hamburg, Germany which produces browser based MMORPG games that are unique in that do not require any downloads to play.

Founded by Heiko Hubertz in December of 2002, Bigpoint has experienced record growth (more than 4500% in 5 years) since its creation and won numerous business awards including the Red Herring Award in 2007 - placing it among the top 100 most innovative businesses - and the Ruban d'Honneur at the European Business Awards in 2009.

In June of 2008 a 70% controlling share of Bigpoint GmbH was purchased by NBCU's and GE's joint venture Peacock Equity Fund and UK PE Firm GMT Communications Partners in a $110m (€70m) deal that gave each a 35% share of the company.

This allowed the three initial venture capital investors - Aurelia Private Equity, European Founders Fund and United Internet Beteiligungen - to sell out while CEO Heiko Hubertz re-invested his share of the sale to retain a 30% stake in the company.

Heiko Hubertz currently acts as the company's Managing Director.

Bigpoint has a portfolio of more than 40 games translated into 20 languages, with the two largest being SeaFight with approximately 15.7 million registered users and Dark Orbit with approximately 14.2 million registered users.

The company claims to receive more than 200,000 new user registrations each day.
