Collingwood School

Collingwood School is a private school in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It teaches from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12.

Collingwood School was opened in 1984 by West Vancouver and North Vancouver parents who wanted a private school nearby. The school was named after a ship called the HMCS Collingwood. The school used the buildings from the old Glenmore Elementary School. Now the school has buildings in two different parts of West Vancouver.

The "Morven" campus is the oldest part of the school. This is where they teach the older children, from Grade 6 to Grade 12. It is in a part of West Vancouver called the British Properties. The address is 70 Morven Drive, West Vancouver. The "Wentworth" campus was built later. This is where they teach the younger children, from Junior Kindergarten to Grade 5. It is right below Cypress Provincial Park in West Vancouver.
