Honeycrisp

Honeycrisp ("Malus domestica" 'Honeycrisp') is an apple cultivar that was made at the Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station's Horticultural Research Center at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. Named in 1974 as the MN 1711, and released in 1991, the Honeycrisp has rapidly become a prized commercial commodity, as its sweetness, firmness, and tartness make it a good apple for eating raw. The Honeycrisp also keeps its pigment well and has a long shelf life when kept in cool, dry areas.
