Jack Darragh

John Proctor "Jack" Darragh (December 4, 1890 – June 25, 1924) was a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger. He played parts of 13 years of professional ice hockey, all with the Ottawa Senators.

On December 27, 1910, Darragh signed a contract with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey Association (NHA). Darragh played with them until the NHA folded. After the Senators joined the National Hockey League (NHL), they decided to keep him on the team. When he became a free agent, he signed another contract with the Senators on December 4, 1922.

During his time with the Senators, Darragh won four Stanley Cups with them. He won them in 1911, 1920, 1921, and 1923. After his final cup win, he decided to retire from playing professional ice hockey. On June 25, 1924, he died from peritonitis, caused by a ruptured appendix.

Darragh was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1963.
