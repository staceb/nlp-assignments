Piggott, Arkansas

Piggott is a city of the state of Arkansas in the United States of America. In 2000 there were about 3,900 people living in Piggott which is the largest city in Clay County. The town was first called Huston, but was later named Piggott after Dr. James Piggott, an early resident. In 1956 the town was used as the main location in Elia Kazan's movie, "A Face in the Crowd", starring Lee Remick and Andy Griffith.

American author Ernest Hemingway visited Piggot many times during the 1930s. His second wife's parents, Paul and Mary Pfeiffer, lived in Piggott. They converted a barn into a studio where Hemingway could write. He wrote a lot of his novel "A Farewell to Arms" in the studio. The house and barn are now the Hemingway-Pfeiffer Museum and Educational Center which is run by Arkansas State University.
