Scotland national football team

Scotland national football team is the national football team of Scotland, currently managed by former Dundee United manager Craig Levein who took over from George Burley on 23rd December 2009.

Scotland has the joint oldest national football team in the world as they played England in the first ever international football match in 1872. 

Hampden Park in Glasgow is the home of the Scotland national team and is described by the Scottish Football Association as the "National Stadium". The stadium, which can hold 52,000 people, is one of several stadiums to have used the name. Hampden and its predecessors have hosted international matches since 1878. A record of 149,415 people was set by the Scotland v England match in 1937. Hampden is one of only two Scottish football stadiums to receive a UEFA 5–star rating.

Since the last redevelopment to Hampden was completed in 1999, Scotland have played all but one of their competitive matches there. Only when Celtic Park hosted the first Euro 2008 qualification match against the Faroe Islands. Celtic Park was used because the fixtures were decided by a random draw and Hampden had already been booked for a Robbie Williams concert on the same date.
