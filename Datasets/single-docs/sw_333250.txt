Jay Christopher Cutler is an American football quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League.

He played for the Vanderbilt Commodores football team during his college days, with his final play being a touchdown throw to future Bears teammate Earl Bennett. He formerly played for the Denver Broncos, who drafted him in the first round of the 2006 NFL Draft. Cutler was traded to Chicago for Kyle Orton and a first-round pick in 2009. Cutler was named to the Pro Bowl in 2008. In 2010, after the Bears' loss to the Green Bay Packers in the Conference Championship, people criticized Cutler, calling him a quitter after he hurt his knee.
