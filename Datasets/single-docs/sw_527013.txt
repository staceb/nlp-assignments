Piña colada

A piña colada is a special kind of mixed cocktail. It is usually made of rum, coconut cream, and pineapple juice. It is usually served either blended or shaken with ice. It may be garnished with either a pineapple wedge, a maraschino cherry, or both. The piña colada is the national drink of Puerto Rico. Several claim to be the first to invent the piña colada. Bartender Ramon “Monchito” Marrero is claimed to be the inventor over fifty years ago by the Puerto Rican government. But there are three places in Puerto Rico that claim to be the home of the Piña Colada. There was also a version made in Cuba as early as 1922.
