Ski bindings

Ski bindings keep ski boots connected to skis. The first ski bindings were ropes connect to the ski. People put their boot under the rope.

There are different ski bindings for alpine skiing and Nordic skiing. Alpine ski bindings connect the bottom of the ski boot to the ski. Nordic ski bindings connect the toe of the ski boot to the ski.
