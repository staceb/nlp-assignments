Derrick Mason

Derrick James Mason (born January 17, 1974 in Detroit, Michigan is a former American football wide receiver and returner. He played college football for Michigan State University. He never won a Super Bowl. Mason was known for his work ethnic (motivation), but sometimes took it too far when he did not receive the ball, like he sometimes did with Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco.

In the National Football League, Mason was drafted by the Tennessee Titans in 1997. He played as a returner and wideout and helped Tennessee to a Super Bowl XXXIV appearance. Before the 2005 season, Mason signed with the Baltimore Ravens. With Baltimore, Mason became a very successful veteran receiver. He is their all-time leading wideout.

In 2011 however, the Ravens released Mason. Mason spent portions of 2011 with the New York Jets and Houston Texans, where there was more controversy (arguments, etc.) He announced that he was going to retire from professional football after he signed a 1-day contract with Baltimore Ravens on June 11, 2012.
