Pokémon Puzzle Challenge

Pokémon Puzzle Challenge is a puzzle video game for the Game Boy Color game console. It was released in Japan on September 21, 2000, in North America on December 4, 2000, and in Europe on June 15, 2001. It is based upon Nintendo's "Panel de Pon" video game series, with a "Pokémon Gold and Silver" theme.

Players clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to be of the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield goes up. If the playfield reaches the top, the game ends. The player can stop the playfield by clearing blocks. The more lines a player clears at once, the higher their score will be.

There are three modes of play: single-player, multi-player, and training. Players can play as a number of different Pokémon from "Pokémon Gold and Silver", including Pikachu, Cyndaquil, and Totodile. New Pokémon can be unlocked by winning against other Pokémon trainers.
