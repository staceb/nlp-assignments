Gypsy Taub

Oxane "Gypsy" Taub (born 1970) is one of San Francisco's most well-known activist in naturism and "body freedom" of the past decade.

On June 18, 2015, Taub along with activist George Davis settled a lawsuit with the city of San Francisco with a one time payment of $20,000 to the plaintiffs, who had hoped to overturn the city's 2013 ban on unregulated public nudity.

On September 25, 2015, a federal judge ordered San Francisco to issue a parade permit to Taub’s group for another naked march after the city had previously denied their applications.

In December 2015, Taub was characterized as San Francisco's most notorious nudist.

On August 7, 2016, Taub organized a four-hour nude "Summer of Love" event with a parade from Jane Warner Plaza to the edge of Golden Gate Park and back, followed by nude dancing at the Plaza.
