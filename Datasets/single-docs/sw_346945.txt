Helmet (band)

Helmet is an alternative metal band from New York. The band was formed in 1989 by vocalist and lead guitarist Page Hamilton, who is their only constant member. 

Helmet became popular when they released their 1992 major-label debut "Meantime", which peaked at number 68 on the "Billboard" 200 and featured their best known songs "Unsung" and "In the Meantime". "Meantime" is also Helmet's only album to go gold in the United States. They made two more albums before breaking up in 1998. However, Helmet reformed in 2004 and released a new album later that year. The album was called "Size Matters" and was their last release on their longtime label Interscope Records. Helmet was briefly signed to Warcon Records, who released their next album "Monochrome" in 2006, but today, they are signed to Work Song Records. That label released their latest album "Seeing Eye Dog" in 2010.

So far, Helmet has released seven full-length studio albums, which include:
