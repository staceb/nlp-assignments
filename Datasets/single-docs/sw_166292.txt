Native (ecology)

A species is called indigenous or native to a place when that species lives there because of the natural environment, not human change. A species is an indigen if it lives in the wild and has not had artificial selection by humans. 

If a species is in a place because it was moved by humans, the species is not indigenous to that place. It is an introduced species.
