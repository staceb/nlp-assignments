Iyengar Yoga

Iyengar Yoga is a type of yoga named after and developed by B. K. S. Iyengar (1918-2014). It is a form of Hatha Yoga. It emphasizes detail, precision and alignment. It focuses performing postures (poses) and breath control. This type of yoga helps to develop strength, mobility and stability. 

B. K. S. Iyengar has created over 200 yoga poses. Students start with simple poses and move on to more complex ones.

Iyengar Yoga often uses belts, blocks, and blankets to help people get into the postures. By using belts, blocks and blankets, people are less likely to hurt themselves.
