William J. Coyne

William Joseph Coyne (August 24, 1936 – November 3, 2013) was an American politician. He was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania. 

Coyne was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He graduated from Central Catholic High School in 1954, and received a B.S. in accounting from Robert Morris College. 

Coyne was elected to Congress in 1980, succeeding 24-year incumbent William S. Moorhead in a district taking in most of Pittsburgh. He was reelected ten times, never facing serious opposition. He was a longtime member of the United States House Committee on Ways and Means

In 2002, Coyne's district was combined with the district of Mike Doyle, a somewhat more moderate Democrat. Although the new district contained more of Coyne's territory than Doyle's, Coyne retired to avoid the possibility of two Democratic incumbents facing each other in the primary elections. 

Coyne died at the age of 77 on November 3, 2013, two months after falling and sustaining head injuries in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
