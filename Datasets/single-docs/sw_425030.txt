Insignificance

Insignificance is a feeling that nothing you do matters, or that you are not important. People may feel this for many reasons. For example, having low self-esteem, being depressed, living in a large city with many people, comparing themselves to rich celebrity success stories, working in a large bureaucracy, or being in awe of a natural wonder.

People living in crowded, major cities may face feelings of insignificance. George Simmel says that when people live in a big city, they may start to feel like "...just another face in the crowd", it can "lead to feelings of insignificance...".
