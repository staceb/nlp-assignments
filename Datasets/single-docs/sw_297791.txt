Cashpoint Arena Altach

The Cashpoint Arena is a football stadium in Altach, Vorarlberg, Austria. It is the homeground of SCR Rheindorf Altach, a football club playing in Austrian Football First League, which is the second level in Austrias football.

The stadium was built 1989/90 and was opened on 1 June 1990 under the name Schnabelholz. 1998 the main stand of the stadium was completely roofed. After the promotion to the First league a floodlighting was installed. After the promotion to the Bundesliga a new stand with 1 800 seats was built because the Bundesliga regulates 3000 seats at least. The stadium now offers over 3000 roofed seats. 2006 the match versus SK Rapid Wien was visited by 8 900 people which is the record till today. 

The stadium offers a unique athmosphere because the visitors are near to the playing field. But the stadium is not only used for football but also for open air concerts and other events.
