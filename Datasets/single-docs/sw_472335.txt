Communications receiver

A communications receiver is a radio receiver which is specially suited for receiving shortwave radio stations. Unlike other radio stations, shortwave stations are usually broadcast from one sender only. They can then be received all over the world. The upper class communications receivers are also able to receive differently modulated radio signals, such as single-sideband modulation.
