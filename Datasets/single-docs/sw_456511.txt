Corduroy

Corduroy is a strong fabric. It is made of twisted fibers. When woven, the fibers are parallel to one another in ridges. This makes the corduroy look striped. Corduroy is used to make clothing, including trousers, jackets and shirts. It is also used for furniture, including couches..

The ridges in the fabric are called "wales". Corduroy can have from 1.5 to 21 wales per inch. It usually has between 10 and 12 wales per inch. Corduroy with fewer wales per inch is more often used to make trousers and for furniture. Corduroy with more wales per inch is usually used for clothing worn above the waist.

Some people think the word "corduroy" comes from the French words "corde du roi" ("the cord of the King"). There is no evidence that this is true.

Other names are used for corduroy. Some of those names are corded velveteen, elephant cord, pin cord, Manchester cloth and cords.

In continental Europe, corduroy is often called "Manchester" or "Cord".
