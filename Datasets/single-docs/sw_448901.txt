Santeria (song)

"Santeria" is the second single off American ska punk band Sublime's third and final studio album "Sublime". The song was released on January 7, 1997. 

The title of the song refers to Santería, a religion practiced in the Caribbean. The song tells a story about a jealous ex-boyfriend that plans to take revenge out on the man that stole his girlfriend. He mentions using violent force when he talks about "popping a cap in Sancho" and "putting that barrel straight down Sancho's throat". Lead singer Bradley Nowell refers to the man as "sancho" and his ex-girlfriend as "heina". In Mexico, "sancho" is often used to describe a man who steals another man's girlfriend. "heina" is used to describe a man's woman or girlfriend.

The song was featured in the 2008 video game "Guitar Hero World Tour" and as a downloadable song in the 2010 video game "Rock Band 3". The song was also featured in the 2012 movie "This Is 40".
