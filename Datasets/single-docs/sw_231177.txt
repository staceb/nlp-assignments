Picture book

A picture book is a book that combines words and pictures to tell a story. They are usually for young children to read. The pictures are illustrations that show different parts of the story. The written part of the book is often short and basic, using words that a child can understand.

The earliest illustrated book made for children was "Orbis Pictus" by John Amos Comenius. It was published in 1658. One of the earliest picture books in English was Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" from 1866. The drawings in it were done by John Tenniel. Beatrix Potter's "The Tale of Peter Rabbit" was published in 1902. Potter did all her own illustrations, which are watercolour paintings. Some of the best-known picture books are "Make Way for Ducklings", "The Cat in the Hat", and "Where the Wild Things Are".
