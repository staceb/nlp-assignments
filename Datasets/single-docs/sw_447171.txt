Dewey Defeats Truman

"Dewey Defeats Truman" was a famously incorrect headline on the front page of the "Chicago Tribune". It was published on November 3, 1948. 

It happened the day after incumbent United States President Harry S. Truman won an upset victory over Republican challenger and Governor of New York Thomas E. Dewey in the 1948 presidential election.
