Guilder

Guilder is the English translation of the Dutch gulden, meaning "golden". The guilder used to be a gold coin, but has been a used for silver or metal coins for some centuries. The name is also called florin. The guilder was used most in the Netherlands (as the Dutch guilder), until it was replaced by the euro on 1 January 2002. The Netherlands Antillean guilder is currently the only guilder officially in use, though the Netherlands no longer accepts the currency in their banks.
