Here Without You

"Here Without You" is the third single off American rock band 3 Doors Down's second studio album "Away from the Sun". The song was released on August 11, 2003.

On the "Billboard" charts, "Here Without You" was able to peak at #5 on the Hot 100 chart.

Lead singer Brad Arnold said that his inspiration for this song was his now ex-wife. Arnold said "The song's about being away from someone, or missing them. And it really doesn't matter if you're here without them for all day or all month. It's about the loneliness and missing of somebody". The song was used by the WWE in a tribute video to professional wrestler Eddie Guerrero after he died from a heart attack in November 2005.
