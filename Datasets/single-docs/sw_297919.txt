Burke and Wills expedition

The Burke and Wills expedition, officially called the Victorian Exploring Expedition, was the largest and best equipped in Australian history. Led by Robert O'Hara Burke and William John Wills, they crossed the continent of Australia from south to north. The group left Melbourne on 20 August 1860 and reached the Gulf of Carpentaria on 9 February 1861. However, because of poor planning and leadership, Burke and Wills died from starvation at Cooper Creek on their return journey.
