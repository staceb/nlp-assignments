Priest Holmes

Priest Holmes (born October 7, 1973) is a former American Football runningback. He played college football for the Texas Longhorns. Holmes went undrafted into the NFL in 1997. He was signed by the Baltimore Ravens. In 1998, he rushed for 1,008 yards and seven touchdowns after not playing the previous year. In 2000, Baltimore picked Jamal Lewis, and Holmes became a backup. The Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV that year. Holmes, wanting more playing time, signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. He rushed for well over 1,000 yards in his first three seasons with the team. Injuries bothered Holmes during his later time in Kansas City. He was again replaced by a younger runningback, Larry Johnson. He retired on November 21, 2007.

On November 2, 2014, he was inducted into the Chiefs Hall of Fame.
