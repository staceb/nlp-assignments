Ordinary (liturgy)

The catholic mass is made of two parts: One that changes during the year, and the other one that does not. The one that does not change is usually called Ordinary. The part that canges is usually called Proper. The Latin names for these are "Ordinarium" and "Proprium". When talkin about the music performed in Church, an ordinary usually consists of the following (which are either songs or prayers):
Protestant and Eastern Orthodox often use the same songs, but they have adapted the texts. Nowadays, the text is often translated to the local language.
