Anglo-Saxon architecture

Anglo-Saxon architecture was a period in the history of architecture in England and parts of Wales, from the mid-5th century until the Norman Conquest of 1066. Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, made from wood with thatch for roofing.

There are few remains of Anglo-Saxon architecture. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick.
