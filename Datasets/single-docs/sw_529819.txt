Denny's

Denny's is a pancake house and casual family restaurant. It has more than 1,600 restaurants in the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, Canada, Central America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan. It serves pancakes, eggs, sausage and more.

From the 1990s to the 2010s, Denny's was involved in serious controversy. They were accused of discrimination. In 1994, in San Jose, California, several black teenagers were told they had to pay before getting their food. In 2014, an LGBT group accused a Denny's location in Deming, New Mexico of discrimination. The group said that the wait staff said homophobic things and refused to serve them. The LGBT customers were attending a gay pride celebration.
