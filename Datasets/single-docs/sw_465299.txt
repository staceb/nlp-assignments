Jaén Cathedral

The Assumption of the Virgin Cathedral is a Spanish Renaissance cathedral located in Santa María Square in Jaén, Spain. It is across from the Town Hall and the Episcopal Palace (Archbishop's palace). The Santa María Square is one of the historical sites in Jaén. The cathedral stands on the same ground that was once occupied by an early mosque. 
Construction of the cathedral began in 1249. It was built on the ruins of an early Spanish mosque. It was damaged and rebuilt on numerous occasions during the following two centuries. In the sixteenth century Andrés de Vandelvira built the biggest part of the Cathedral. It was consecrated in 1724.
The more representative architectural element is its façade. It was designed by Eufrasio López de Rojas. It was sculpted by Pedro Roldán. It houses the Veil of Veronica. In 1545 the young Francisco Guerrero was the "maestro de capilla".

Jaén Cathedral is one of 100 finalists for the 12 Treasures of Spain in 2007.
