2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted

"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted" (sometimes called "Gangsta Party") is the second single from American rapper 2Pac's fifth studio album "All Eyez on Me". The song was a duet sung by 2Pac and Snoop Dogg. It was released as a promotional single and was written by 2Pac, Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger. It is sometime referred to as "Gangsta Party" because of the line "ain't nuthin but a gangsta party" in the chorus.
