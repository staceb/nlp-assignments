Scarification

Scarification or cicatrization is a form of body modification, where a design or pattern is cut, etched or scratched into human skin to make a permanent scar. Like with most body modification, there are many reasons why people choose to be scarified. The act of scarifying has been compared to tattooing due to the fact that it permanently changes the skin. It has also been identified with self harm because people have used it to cover self-inflicted wounds.

Scarification began as cultural identification in some places, especially in Maori and African societies. Other cultures may use it for religious reasons, and nearly all cultures use it for aesthetics. Some people also use scarification for pleasure, as the process of being scarified creates endorphins.
