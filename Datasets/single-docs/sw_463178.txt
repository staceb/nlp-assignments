Mark Messier

Mark Douglas Messier (born January 18, 1961) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey centre and a former special assistant to the president and general manager of the New York Rangers. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) from 1979 until 2004. He played for the Edmonton Oilers, New York Rangers, and Vancouver Canucks. He also played in the World Hockey Association (WHA). He was nicknamed "The Moose" because of his aggressiveness and strength. 

He is considered to be one of the greatest NHL players of all time that was unable to win an Olympic medal. Messier is listed second on the all-time career lists for regular season points (1887), playoff points (295) and regular season games played (1756). During his career, he was able to win six Stanley Cups, winning it five times the Oilers and one time with the Rangers. He is the only player to have captained two different professional teams to championships. During his time with New York, he was nicknamed "The Messiah" because of his playoff leadership while there, which helped end a 54-year Stanley Cup drought in 1994. He is a two-time Hart Trophy winner, winning it in 1990 and 1992. Messier is only one of two players (the other being Wayne Gretzky) to have won the Hart Trophy with more than one team. He was also a one-time Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the most valuable player during the playoffs in 1984. He was named as an NHL All-Star 15 times during his career and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame on November 12, 2007.
