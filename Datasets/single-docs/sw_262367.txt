Menai Strait

The Menai Strait (, the "River Menai") is a narrow stretch of water which separates the island of Anglesey from the mainland of Wales. It is in the northwest corner of Wales. The straight is about 25km long. The water is not very deep. There are two bridges over the strait. The A5 road (which goes all the way to central London), goes across by the Menai Suspension Bridge. There is also the Britannia Tubular Bridge.
