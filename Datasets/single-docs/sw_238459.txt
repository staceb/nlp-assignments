Mary Cassatt

Mary Stevenson Cassatt (May 22, 1844 – June 14, 1926) was an American artist. She lived in France for many years. She often painted mothers and children.

Cassatt was born in Allegheny City, Pennsylvania, which is now part of Pittsburgh, to rich parents. She was one out of seven kids. As a child, she traveled a lot in Europe, including visits to London, Paris, and Berlin. Back in the United States, she studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 

She moved to Paris, France in 1866, returning to the US in 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War. 

Degas influenced Cassatt. She used pastels, making many important works with them. He also taught her etching. 

She had less time in the 1890's. She became less blunt in her opinions. Other American artists sought her advice. Among them was Lucy A. Bacon.,

From 1891 to 1893, she painted a large mural for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair (Columbian Exposition). The mural had three parts - the central theme was "Young Women Plucking the Fruits of Knowledge or Science." The left panel was "Young Girls Pursuing Fame" and the right panel "Arts, Music, Dancing." The mural was lost after the fair was over. 
She died on June 14, 1926 at Château de Beaufresne, near Paris, and was buried in the family vault at Le Mesnil-Théribus, France.
