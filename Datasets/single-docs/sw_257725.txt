Mur de la peste

The Mur de la peste or plague wall was built in the Vaucluse Mountains to stop the spread of the plague. Between 1720 and 1722, there was an epidemic in the Provence and in Marseille. The wall is built of dry stone, and was about 27 km long. Today, a part of the wall still stands, near Murs. Along the wall, there were watchtowers for guardposts.
