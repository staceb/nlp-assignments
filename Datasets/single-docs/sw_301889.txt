Vindex

Gaius Iulius Vindex was a Roman governor who is famous for rebelling in 67/68AD against the Emperor Nero.

Vindex was the governor of a province in Gaul (modern-day France). He rebelled against Nero's high taxes. In order to become more powerful, he allied with the governor of Hispania (modern-day Spain), Galba (who would become ruler during the "year of the four emperors").

Vindex was killed in battle by Rufus, the governor of Germania (modern-day Germany), however, when Nero killed himself and Galba became emperor (June 68AD), Galba made coins dedicated to Vindex.
