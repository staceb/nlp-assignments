A Visit from St. Nicholas

"A Visit from St. Nicholas" is a poem by Clement Clarke Moore. It was first published anonymously on December 23, 1823 in the "Troy Sentinel", an American newspaper. It is also known as "The Night Before Christmas" and "'Twas the Night Before Christmas" from its first line. The poem is largely responsible for the way many people think of Santa Claus. It describes his physical appearance, the night of his visit, his sleigh, the number and names of his reindeer, and the tradition that he brings toys to children.
