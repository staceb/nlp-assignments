Western Canada

Western Canada is a region of Canada. The region includes the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. The last three provinces are sometimes called the Prairie Provinces.

Sometimes "Western Canada" includes the territories of Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut. These territories are now often grouped as the distinct region of Northern Canada.
