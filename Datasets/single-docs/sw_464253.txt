Reagan Democrat

Reagan Democrat is an American political saying that was used by analysts showing how Democratic voters would support Republican President Ronald Reagan rather than Jimmy Carter or Walter Mondale. This was said during both the 1980 and 1984 elections. It is also used for George H. W. Bush in the 1988 election.
