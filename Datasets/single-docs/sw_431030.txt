Surge

Surge was a soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. The product was made mostly in the United States beginning in early 1997. The soda was marketed as a substitute to Mountain Dew and to take customers from Pepsi. The brand was very popular at first, but that didn't last.

Surge stopped being made in 2003. Surge was re-released by Coca-Cola as an Amazon exclusive in packs of 12 16oz can because of the success of the "Surge Movement" campaign on September 15, 2014.
