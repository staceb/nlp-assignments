Water bottle

A water bottle is a container that is used to hold water, liquids or other beverages for drinking. Using a water bottle allows people to transport, and drink, a beverage from one place to another.

Water bottles can be either disposable or reusable. Some water bottles are reusable and can help save the environment by reducing waste.
