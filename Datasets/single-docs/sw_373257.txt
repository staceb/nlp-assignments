Walter Savage Landor

Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) also known as WS Landor, was an English poet and essayist. 

He was the son of a doctor. He was sent to the famous Rugby School in 1784, but was removed in 1791, to avoid expulsion. He then went up to study at Trinity College, Oxford University but was also rusticated from there in 1794. After this, he developed some problems with his father, who was very angry at him, so Landor left his home. 

In 1794-95, he prepared his first book of poems, published in 1795 as "The Poems of Walter Savage Landor". This was followed by "Gebir" (1798), "Poetry" (1802), "Imaginary Conversations" (series, 1824-1829) and other works. 

He was also for some time married to Julia Thuillier and settled in France for a short time, then moved to Italy. After fighting with his wife, he left her and returned to England in 1835. In 1853 he published his last book, "Last Fruit off an Old Tree" and then, in 1858, left England again and went and settled in Europe. He died in 1864.
