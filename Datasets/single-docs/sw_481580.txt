Managing editor

A Managing Editor is a senior member of a Mass media management team. In radio and television networks the managing editor is the top executive. At local stations, a managing editor works directly under the news director. In newspaper publishing the Managing Editor (ME) reports directly to the editor-in-chief. In most organizations the managing editor can hire, fire, or promote staff members. In network broadcasting, the job of managing editor may be combined with other jobs. For example on NBC, Tom Brokaw was both anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News. At CNN Lou Dobbs was an anchor, managing editor and executive vice president. At the Fox News Channel, Brit Hume was an anchor and the Washington DC division's managing editor.
