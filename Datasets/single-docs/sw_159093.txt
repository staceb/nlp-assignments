Getae

The Getae (, singular Γέτης) was the name given by the Greeks and Romans to several Thracian tribes who lived in the region south of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria, and north of the Lower Danube, in Romania. They spoke the ancient Thracian language like their neighbors, the Dacians. There was also a branch of Tyragetae on the Dniester River, and two tribes of Massagetae and Thyssagetae in Scythia. Many historians of the 4th to 6th centuries AD referred to the Goths, who then lived in the same area north of the Danube, as "Getae".
