Ski boots

Ski boots are boots people wear when skiing. They cover the ankle and are rigid. Ski boots are connected to skis by ski bindings. They are made from synthetic materials. Ski boots keep the feet of skiers warm. 

Before the 1900s, people used normal boots for skiing. The first boots for skiing were made by military people fighting in the Russo-Finnish War. 

The front of Nordic ski boots connect to the ski at the toes.
