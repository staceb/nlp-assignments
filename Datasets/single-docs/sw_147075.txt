British Rail Class 57

The British Rail Class 57 diesel locomotives were made by Brush Traction between 1997 and 2004. They are rebuilds, with new engines, of older Class 47 locomotives, originally introduced in 1964–1965. They are known as "bodysnatchers", or "Zombies" to enthusiasts, because the shell (body) of the class 47 has been stripped, rewired and re-engined.
