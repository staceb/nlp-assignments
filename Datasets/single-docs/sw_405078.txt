Bois de la Cambre

Bois de la Cambre () is a forest in Brussels. It used to be part of the Sonian Forest but now it is separate.

The main road around the lake has been closed to traffic on Saturdays and Sundays since the 1990s.

In 1815, on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo, the British soldiers played cricket on land that is now part of the Bois de la Cambre.

In the 1990s the Chalet Robinson was built on the an island on the lake. The restaurant was destroyed by a fire in 1991. The decision was made in 2006 to rebuild it and it reopened to the public in September 2009. An electrical boat has been made so you can pass from the shore to the island.
