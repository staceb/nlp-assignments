Rembert Dodoens

Rembert Dodoens (29 June 1517 – 10 March 1585) was a Flemish physician and botanist. He is also known by his Latinized name Rembertus Dodonaeus.

Dodoens was born in Mechelen. In 1530 he began his studies in medicine, cosmography and geography at the University of Leuven. He graduated in 1535. He became a physician in Mechelen in 1538. He married Kathelijne De Bruyn(e) in 1539. He had a short stay in Basel (1542–1546). He turned down a chair at the University of Leuven in 1557. He also turned down an offer to become court physician of emperor Philip II of Spain. He became the court physician of the Austrian emperor Rudolph II in Vienna (1575–1578). He then became professor in medicine at the University of Leiden in 1582, and remained there until his death.

Dodoens wrote "Cruydeboeck" in 1554. In his times, it was the most translated book after the Bible. It became a work of worldwide renown, used as a reference book for two centuries.

The plant genus "Dodonaea" was named after him by Carolus Linnaeus.
