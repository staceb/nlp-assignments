Lambada

The Lambada is a dance from Brazil. It is sometimes called the "forbidden dance". It started in the late 1970s. It became most popular in the 1980s. Its popularity was mostly in Latin American and Caribbean countries.

The Lambada is a dance for two people. The dance is done with bent legs. Steps are usually side to side, with turns. There are pronounced movements for the hips. Around the time the Lambada became popular, the women often wore short skirts. These skirts swirl up when the woman turns. Sometimes the woman's thong underwear is seen during the turns.
