Illustrator

An illustrator is an artist who draws. The drawings can be on books, internet webpages or other things. They can describe ideas or objects that are hard to describe with just words. A cartoon illustration can make a humorous essay funnier. Illustrators also helped greatly in times when many people could not read.
