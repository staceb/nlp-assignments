Cashmere wool

Cashmere wool is a kind of fiber which is produced from the wool of cashmere goats. Most cashmere wool is produced in China, Mongolia, Iran, and the Asiatic highlands known as Pamir. Large farms can also be found in Australia, New Zealand and Scotland. Cashmere wool is among the most valuable kinds of natural fiber. For this reason, textiles are often mixed with merino wool.
