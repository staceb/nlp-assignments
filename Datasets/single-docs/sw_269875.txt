Janenschia

Janenschia (named after Werner Janensch) was a huge, plant-eating dinosaur with an elongated neck and tail. It was a sauropod from the late Jurassic period, about 156 million to 150 million years ago. "Janenschia" had a small head, blunt teeth, and a short, thick tail; it was about 80 feet (24 m) long. This titanosaurid back may have been covered with bony, armored plates. Fossils have been found in Tanzania, Africa.
