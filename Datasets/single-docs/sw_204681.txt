Eurolang

Eurolang is an international planned language created by Philip Hunt between 1995 and 1998 in order to be a language for the European Union. The author stated as a principle of the design that the language should be very easy to learn for Europeans. In contrast with other languages like Esperanto, Eurolang includes a large number of words directly borrowed from English.

At present there's no known community of active speakers of Eurolang. The website of the author in which he described the language has disappeared from the net.
