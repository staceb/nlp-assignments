Robert Merry's Museum

Robert Merry's Museum was a 19th-century American monthly children's magazine. It was founded in 1841 by Samuel Griswold Goodrich in Boston, Massachusetts. The original Boston publisher was Bradbury & Soden. The monthly began publication as a 12.5 cent, 32 page magazine in February 1841. The number of pages had grown to 48 by November 1872, at which time the magazine was absorbed by "The Youthful Companion".

The magazine was edited in the beginning by Goodrich. A number of editors followed him. Children's writer Louisa May Alcott edited between 1867 and 1869. She edited under her own name though other editors of the magazine used fictional names like "Aunt Sue", "Uncle Miles", "Hiram Hatchet", etc. Goodrich edited under "Robert Merry" and "Peter Parley".
