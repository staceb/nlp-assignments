Somersault

A somersault is an acrobatic move where a person moves the feet over the head whilst in mid-air. The somersault can be done forwards, backwards, or sideways and is similar to a "flip" (or, if performed backwards, a "backflip"). 
A backwards somersault while still moving forward is called a "Gainer"

The word comes from the old French word "sombresault", which is no longer used.
