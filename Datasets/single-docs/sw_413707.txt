Penn's Creek Massacre

The Penn's Creek Massacre was a massacre committed by Delaware Indians on 16 October 1755. It happened near what is present day Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania. Made bold by Braddock's defeat on July 9, Indians killed and pillaged along the Pennsylvania frontier. Fourteen settlers were killed at Penn's Creek. Eleven were taken captive. One was wounded, but escaped. A posse sent to investigate was attacked, and both posse members and Indians were killed. Some of those taken captive in the Penn's Creek Massacre eventually returned to civilization alive.
