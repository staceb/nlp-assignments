Crab rangoon

Crab rangoon are deep-fried dumplings. They are served in American Chinese restaurants. They are stuffed with a combination of cream cheese, lightly flaked crab meat with scallions and/or garlic. These fillings are then wrapped in Chinese wonton wrappers. They are then deep fried in vegetable oil.

In the Pacific Northwest states of America crab rangoon are also known as crab puffs.
