Andros Island is an archipelago in the Bahamas. It is the largest of the 26 inhabited Bahamian Islands. The land area of Andros has hundreds of small islets and cays connected by mangrove estuaries and tidal swamp lands. There are three major islands—North Andros, Mangrove Cay, and South Andros. It is 104 miles (167 km) long by at its widest 40 miles (64 km) wide.
