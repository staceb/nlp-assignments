Irrigation sprinkler

Sprinkler irrigation is a way of artificially watering plants. A sprinkler irrigation system is a pressurized system, which means it needs water under pressure to work. There are many different types of irrigation sprinklers. Some are used in home gardens, and some are used on farms.

A permanent sprinker system is made of a pump to take water and create pressure, and a network of pipes leading to the sprinkler heads. Usually the sprinkler head is on a small pipe that comes out of the ground.
