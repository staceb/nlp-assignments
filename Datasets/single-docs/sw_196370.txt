Gumti River

Gumti River originates from Dumbur in the northeastern hilly region of the Tripura Division, that is part of the so-called Chittagonian agency.

The Gumti is a hilly river having a strong current. Its flow varies from 100 to 20,000 ft³/s at Comilla. During the rains its average breadth is about 100 m, it is full from bank to bank and the current is rapid. But during the winter it shrinks and becomes fordable at most places. In a year of normal rainfall the river rises to above 1.5 m than the level of the surrounding areas. Flash floods are common phenomena of this river and it occurs at regular intervals.
