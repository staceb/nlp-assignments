The 411

The 411 were an English female R&B group formed in late 2003. The band sang backup vocals on Lemar's cover of Al Green's "Let's Stay Together". The band took its name after the 1992 Mary J. Blige album "What's the 411?". During their time together as a group, they released one studio album "Between the Sheets" and three top-forty singles before breaking up in 2005.

The group was first formed in 2003 as a 4-piece girl band with Tisha Martin who was an actress at the time and starred in children's television shows "Kerching" and "The Basil Brush Show".

The group's first single, "On My Knees", was a hit in the UK, reaching the top 5. A second single, "Dumb," reached number 3 in the UK and also reached the top 30 in Australia. These singles appeared on their album "Between the Sheets", which the girl group co-wrote all the songs on the album.

The album was certified silver on 10 December 2004.
