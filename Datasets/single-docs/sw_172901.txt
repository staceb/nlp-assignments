Jingisukan

Jingisukan is a mutton dish. It is thought to be first made in Hokkaido, one of Japan’s four major islands, and is most popular on this island.
There are two ways to eat Jingisukan: mutton in sauce, and raw mutton. It is cooked on a special grill. It is usually cooked with many vegetables. For example, bean sprout, onion, carrot, sweet pepper, pumpkin, or cabbage.
The name Jingisukan comes from the famous Mongolian warrior’s name, “Genghis Khan.” This dish was named after him because it is believed to originally come from Mongolia.
