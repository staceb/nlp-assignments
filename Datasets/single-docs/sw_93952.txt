Chevrolet Geo

Geo was a brand of economy cars sold by Chevrolet dealerships. Geo was founded in 1989 to compete with Japanese automotives. Geo's roots date back to the 1970s in which General Motors began selling and offering captive imports. The Buick Opel which was originally an Isuzu Gemini and was also offered to future GM marque Daewoo as the Maepsy (which was sold as a Saehan and later Daewoo model). Geo cars were a joint venture between GM and its Japanese partners which included Toyota, Suzuki and Isuzu. Chevrolet's revived Nova (the Corolla Sprinter) led to Chevrolet Sprint (Suzuki Cultus) and the Spectrum (Isuzu Gemini). All three cars were rebranded as Geo in 1989. Geo was cancelled in 1997 and merged into the Chevrolet brand. The Geo models were the Metro, Prizm, Storm, Tracker, and Spectrum. The Prizm was made at New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. which was jointly owned by Toyota and General Motors. While the Metro and Tracker were made at CAMI Automotive a joint venture between GM and Suzuki, and the Storm and Spectrum were made entirely in Japan by Isuzu, and because of dwindling Isuzu sales they were short-lived. Many Geo models continued as Chevrolet's and were later replaced by in-house cars (i.e. Chevrolet Cobalt (Geo Prizm), a another joint venture vehicle or inherited models from GM Daewoo/Korea.
