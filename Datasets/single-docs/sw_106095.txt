Asparagus

Asparagus is a large genus of flowering plants with over 300 different species. Some of the plants are grown as ornamental plants. One of these is the "asparagus fern", "Asparagus setaceus", which is not a real fern. The best known plant in this group is "Asparagus officinalis", which is grown as a vegetable, and is usually eaten in spring.

Asparagus was one of the plants which Carl von Linné showed in his work "Species Plantarum". "A. officinalis" is used as its type species.

Some species of asparagus are used in cooking.
