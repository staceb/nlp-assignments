Military Cross

The Military Cross (MC) is the third-level military award given to officers and (since 1993) other ranks of the British Armed Forces. Previously it was also awarded to officers of other Commonwealth countries. 

The MC is granted in recognition of "an act or acts of exemplary gallantry during active operations against the enemy on land to all members, of any rank in Our Armed Forces". In 1979, the Queen approved a proposal that some awards, including the Military Cross, could be awarded posthumously.
