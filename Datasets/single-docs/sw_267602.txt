Sodium tellurite

Sodium tellurite is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaTeO. It contains sodium and tellurite ions.

Sodium tellurite is a colorless solid. The tellurite ion can react with water to make sodium hydrogen tellurite, NaHTeO. It dissolves in water easily. It is a weak oxidizing agent (can be reduced to tellurium) and a weak reducing agent (can be oxidized to tellurates). It is part of the process in making tellurium. 

It is made by reacting tellurium dioxide with sodium hydroxide, or by heating a telluride in air with sodium carbonate. 

Sodium tellurite is used in making tellurium. It is also used to make electroplated nickel corrosion-resistant. It can also be used to add a bluish coating to steel. It can be used to isolate certain types of bacteria that it is not toxic to.
