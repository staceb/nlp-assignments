Himiko

Himiko (, about 175 – 248 CE) was the queen of Yamataikoku in ancient Japan. Early Japanese histories do not mention Himiko. The earliest written descriptions of her come from China. There has been much debate over her identity and the location of Yamatai since the late Edo period. Himiko reigned as queen during the 3rd century.
