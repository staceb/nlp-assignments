Station (agriculture)

Station is the term for a big agricultural property (owned land) that is used for raising livestock. The word is used in Australian and New Zealand English. The owner of a station is called a "grazier". They are also sometimes called "pastoralists". Its workers are called "stockmen". The stations may be called "sheep stations" or "cattle stations", depending on what type of animal it raises.
