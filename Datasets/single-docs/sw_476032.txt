Statistics Sweden

Statistics Sweden (, ) is the Swedish government agency that makes the official statistics for Sweden. National statistics in Sweden were first created in 1686 when the Church of Sweden was told to start keeping records on the population. Before the SBC, the Office of Tables (""), was set up in 1749. The current name was changed in 1858.

Since 2008, the agency had about 1,400 employees. The offices of the agency are in Stockholm and Örebro. Statistics Sweden prints the "Journal of Official Statistics".
