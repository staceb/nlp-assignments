Baby boomer

The term baby boomer most commonly refers to people born during the years 1946 to 1964 worldwide. In Canada it is anyone born between 1947 and 1966. Australia identifies baby boomers as those born between 1946 and 1961. Generally, after 1964 the birth rate started falling. In 1951, Sylvia F. Porter, a columnist for the New York Post, first used the term "baby boom" for the rapid rise in birthrate after Word War II.

From 1945 to 1964 about seventy-seven million babies were born in the United States. In the 1950s baby boomers bought Mouse-ear hats after they watched "The Mickey Mouse Club". They danced to rock and roll and idolized singers like Elvis Presley. Hula hoops and Barbie dolls were wildly popular.

By the 1960s many baby boomers were teenagers. They spent nearly $20 million on things including food, clothing, and recorded music. Businesses were eager to find ways to meet their demands. By the 1970s entire industries were changing because of baby boomers.

In 1998 the baby boomers began to discuss about their end-of-life issues; but many commentators think they have became burdens for their children and society. According to the 2011 Associated Press and LifeGoesStrong.com surveys:

60% lost value in investments because of the economic crisis
42% are delaying retirement
25% claim they will never retire (currently still working)

The oldest baby boomers were 67 years old in 2013 and one in five Americans will be 65 years old in 2030. Many people believe they will become a stress on social welfare systems.
