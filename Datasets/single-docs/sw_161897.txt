Moonwalk

The moonwalk or backslide is a dance movement that was made popular worldwide by Michael Jackson. The moonwalk is a dance move in which the dancer appears to be moving forwards, but is actually moving backwards. It is Micheal Jackson's signature move, and in an exclusive interview with Oprah Winfrey, he said that he just adapted the moves of little kids he saw dancing. Michael Jackson first performed the Moonwalk onstage at a concert while singing his popular single "Billie Jean"on "" on March 25, 1983. This special was broadcast May 16, 1983.. He said later that after the performance, he was unhappy and cried backstage because he didn't quite master the dance move.
