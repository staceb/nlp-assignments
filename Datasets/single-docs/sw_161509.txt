Healesville Sanctuary

Healesville Sanctuary, or the Sir Colin MacKenzie Fauna Park, is a zoo at Healesville in Victoria. It only keeps animals that come from Australia. It has a history of breeding Australian animals. In 1943 it became the first zoo to breed a platypus. The only other zoo to have bred a platypus is Sydney's Taronga Zoo. It also helps by breeding the endangered Helmeted honeyeater. It is one of three zoos in Victoria run by Zoos Victoria; the others are the Melbourne Zoo and the Werribee Open Range Zoo.

The zoo is in a natural bush setting. Paths wind through different habitat areas with wallabies, wombats, dingoes, kangaroos, and over 200 Australian birds. There are tours, bird shows and information areas for visitors.
