Hockey puck

A puck is a disk used in some games serving the same use as a ball in ball games. The best-known use of pucks is in ice hockey, a major international sport.

Hockey pucks are hard disks of rubber that are used to play ice hockey. A standard ice hockey puck is black, 1 inch thick (25.4 mm), 3 inches in diameter (76.2 mm), and weighs between 5.5 and 6 ounces (156-170 g). Pucks are often marked with silkscreened team or league logos on one or both faces.
