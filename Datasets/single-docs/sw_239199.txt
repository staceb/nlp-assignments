Potential National Hockey League expansion

The National Hockey League (NHL) has gone through many rounds of expansion and other organizational changes during its nearly 100-year history to reach its current number of thirty teams: twenty-three in the United States, and seven in Canada. On June 22, 2016 the NHL officially approved expansion to Las Vegas starting in the 2017–18 season. The new Las Vegas team was unveiled as the Vegas Golden Knights on November 22 of that year.
