Indian cormorant

The Indian cormorant or Indian shag ("Phalacrocorax fuscicollis") is a member of the cormorant family. It is found mainly along the inland waters of the Indian Subcontinent but extending west to Sindh (S Pakistan) and east to Thailand and Cambodia. It is a gregarious species that can be easily distinguished from the similar sized Little cormorant by its blue eye, small head with a sloping forehead and a long narrow bill ending in a hooked tip.
