António Egas Moniz

António Egas Moniz (António Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas Moniz, 29 November 1874 – 13 December 1955), known as Egas Moniz, was a Portuguese neurologist.

He developed cerebral angiography, a technique to visualise the blood vessels in and around the brain. This technique is widely used today. He also developed the surgical procedure leucotomy, also known as "lobotomy". This technique is now rarely used.

Antonio Egas is highly regarded. He became the first Portuguese national to receive a Nobel Prize when, in 1949, he shared it with Walter Rudolf Hess.

He held academic positions, wrote many medical articles and also served in several legislative and diplomatic posts in the Portuguese government. In 1911 he became professor of neurology in Lisbon until his retirement in 1944. At the same time, he pursued a demanding political career.
