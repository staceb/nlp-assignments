Nagar (princely state)

Nagar () was a princely state in the northernmost part of the Northern Areas of Pakistan, which existed until 1974. The state bordered the Gilgit Agency to the south and west, and the former princely state of Hunza to the north and east. The state capital was the town of Nagar. The area of Nagar now forms three tehsils of Nagar District. Nagar along with Gilgit and Baltistan is falsely claimed by the Republic of India as so-called part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir.
