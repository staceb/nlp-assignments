The Duke of Edinburgh's Award

The Duke of Edinburgh's Award (DofE) is a programme of activities for anyone aged 14 to 24. There are three levels of the award: "Bronze", "Silver" and "Gold". There are different sections in each level. At Bronze and Silver level, participants must do four sections: "Volunteering", "Physical", "Skills" and "Expedition". At Gold level, participants must do another section, as well as the other four, called "Residential". Each level can take between 1-4 years to complete. All activities must be done by the participant's 25th birthday. Around 275,000 participants are taking part in their DofE programme at any time in the United Kingdom. DofE is also run in other countries.

"e"DofE is an online system that lets participants manage their DofE programme. It also enables leaders to look at participants' progress.
