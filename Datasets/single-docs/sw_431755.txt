Seal of Missouri

The Great Seal of the State of Missouri is an emblem that represents the U.S. state of Missouri. It was officially adopted on January 11, 1822. The center of the seal has two bears with the motto: "United we stand, divided we fall". The outer circle has the words "The Great Seal of the State of Missouri".

The year 1820 is shown in Roman numerals. Missouri, however, did not become a state until August 1821.
