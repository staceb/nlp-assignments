Second Viennese School

The Second Viennese School is a group of composers. It was made of Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils and close associates in early 20th century Vienna. Schoenberg lived and taught there between 1903 and 1925. Their music was first like late-Romantic. Later it was a totally chromatic expressionism without firm tonal centre. Later still was Schoenberg's serial twelve-tone technique. 

The main members of the school, besides Schoenberg, were Alban Berg and Anton Webern.
