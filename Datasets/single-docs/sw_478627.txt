Stockholm Eagles

The Stockholm Eagles is a basketball club in Stockholm in Sweden. The club was established in December 2007. In 2012 the club qualified for the Swedish men's top division. After the 2012-2013 season the club was no longer allowed to play in the Swedish top division. The reason was that the club had failed to live up to the economic demands.
