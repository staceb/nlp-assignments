The Eagle

The Eagle originally opened as the Eagle and Child. It is one of the larger pubs in Cambridge. The pub is managed by Greene King Brewery and owned by Corpus Christi College. Apart from the main pub, it has a beer garden. There are drawings and words made by people in the army from World War II in the ceilings and walls. On February 28, 1953 Francis Crick and James Watson discovered "the secret of life" in The Eagle: they had come up with their proposal for the structure of DNA. Today the pub serves a beer to remember this discovery, named Eagle's DNA.
