Bakelite

Bakelite, or polyoxybenzylmethylenglycolanhydride, is an early plastic. It is a thermosetting phenol formaldehyde resin, formed from an elimination reaction of phenol with formaldehyde. It was made in 1907 by Belgian chemist Leo Baekeland.

Bakelite was used for its electrically nonconductivity and heat-resistant properties in electrical insulators, radio and telephone casings. It was also in products as kitchenware, jewelry, pipe stems, and children's toys.
