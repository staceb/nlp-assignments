Lana Clarkson

Lana Clarkson (5 April 1963 - 3 February 2003) was an American actress. She starred in many movies dealing with fantasy, drama and adventure. 

She was born in Long Beach, California and grew up in Napa County, California. 

On February 3, 2003, Clarkson was shot dead in the Alhambra, California mansion of music producer Phil Spector. In the early morning, she met Spector while working at the House of Blues. Both left the House of Blues later in Spector's limousine and drove to his mansion. Spector and Clarkson went inside while his driver waited outside in the car. About an hour later, the driver heard a gunshot before Spector exited his house through the back door with a gun. He was quoted as saying, according to affidavits, "I think I just shot her." 

In 2009, Spector was convicted of murdering Clarkson.
