Army Burn Hall College

Army Burn Hall College (ABHC) formerly Burn Hall School is a school and college in Abbottabad, Pakistan. In 1948, a year after Pakistan gained independence from the British Empire, a few missionary fathers moved to Abbottabad with a handful of students, from Srinagar, Kashmir, where the original school was, and founded a branch here. Between 1948 and 1977, the school was run by these missionary fathers and supervised by the Board of Education of the Rawalpindi Diocese of the Church of Pakistan. However, in 1977 the fathers were forcibly evicted by the Pakistan Army which took over the institution. They made several changes to the school and its spirit and mode of education, gradually bringing it into line with their own goals and objectives. Since 1990-1991, it is no longer a proper public school along the English model but a military-style graduate college, with separate branches for boys and girls.
