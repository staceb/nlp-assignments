Great white pelican

The great white pelican ("Pelecanus onocrotalus") is also known as the Eastern white pelican, white pelican, or old world white pelican. They are the second largest birds in the pelican family, with only the Dalmatian pelican larger than them.

The pelican breeds in southeastern Europe, south Asia, and Africa. They are most common in Africa, as 80% of the 90,000 breeding pairs mate there. However, because of climate change and humans using the wetlands they live in, some populations of great white pelicans are declining.
