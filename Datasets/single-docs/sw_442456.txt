Frankenchrist

Frankenchrist is the third studio album by American hardcore punk band, Dead Kennedys. "Frankenchrist" was released in October 1985. 

The album caused controversy because of a poster that was inserted in the original record sleeve. The poster called "Landscape #XX", or Penis Landscape H. R. Giger, was a painting that showed rows of penises and vulvae. Lead singer Jello Biafra's record label Alternative Tentacles was almost driven to bankruptcy and Biafra was brought to trial for distributing harmful matter to minors but was not convicted. Allmusic rated the album 3.5 out of 5 stars.
