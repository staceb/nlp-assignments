2 Baruch

2 Baruch is a text that was written in the late first century, or the early second century CE. It was probably written after the destruction of the temple in Jerusalem, in 70 CE, and before the second Roman-Jewish War, 132-135 CE. It is attributed to Baruch ben Neriah and is included in some editions of the Old Testament and the Peshitta, but neither Jews nor Christians regard it as scripture. The Syrian Orthodox Church includes it in the Bible. The text has 87 sections and is also known as Syriac Apocalypse of Baruch and Letter of Baruch to the Nine and a Half Tribes.
