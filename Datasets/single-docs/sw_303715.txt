Hydron

In chemistry a proton is a positively charged hydrogen ion. According to IUPAC, the name hydron should be used for such a particle. In this sense, a "hydron" can be a proton in the sense of physics, a "deuteron" or a "triton". A deuteron is the ion of deuterium, a triton that of tritium. (So chemists use the term "hydron" because it covers all three hydrogen ion isotopes.) In 1923, Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Lowry used hydrons to describe acids and bases. They defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors.
