Swiss Chalet

Swiss Chalet is a Canadian chain of casual dining restaurants. Swiss Chalet was started in 1954 in Toronto, Ontario. The restaurant chain is owned by Cara Operations. Swiss chalet's signature food is rotisserie chicken. Their signature dish is the Quarter Chicken Dinner, either a roasted chicken leg or breast with "Chalet Sauce", a bread roll, and a side dish of the customers choice. Other combinations up to and including a whole chicken are also available.

The first Swiss Chalet restaurant was opened at 234 Bloor Street West in Toronto and it operated for 52 years. This restaurant was closed in 2006 and it was demolished in 2009 to make way for condominiums.

In 2008, Swiss Chalet food products were added to Air Canada to be on their buy-on-board menu.
