Emetophobia

Emetophobia is the fear of vomiting or seeing vomiting in public. The phobia is also related to fears of nausea. This condition is more common in females. The fear of vomiting receives little attention compared to other specific phobias.

The problem is often triggered by upsetting or embarrassing incidents in teenage years (12-19).
