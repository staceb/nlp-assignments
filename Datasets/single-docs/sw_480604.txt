Acacia cyclops

The red-eyed wattle or western coastal wattle ("Acacia cyclops") is an Australian tree. It is in the plant family Fabaceae. It is one of nearly 1000 species of "Acacia" in Australia. It is found along the west coast of Western Australia as far north as Jurien Bay, and along the south coast into South Australia. 

Almost all wattles have cream to golden colored flowers. The small flowers are arranged in round groups. Only the male part of the flower sticks out.

Red-eyed wattle can be used to help stabilise coastal sands. It was introduced into Africa for this purpose, but it has spread fast and is now a serious pest in South Africa, where it is known as 'rooikrans' (= 'red garland' in Afrikaans).

The green seed pods may be used as a natural soap, by crushing them and using the pods with water to wash with.
