Fatima Jinnah

Fatima Jinnah (30 July 1893 – 9 July 1967) was a Pakistani dental surgeon, writer, stateswoman and one of the founders of Pakistan. She was the younger sister of Muhammad Ali Jinnah who became the first Governor General of Pakistan.  

She was a strong critic of the British Raj, and a leading member of the All-India Muslim League. She advocated the separation of Pakistan as an independent state when the Raj ended. 

After the independence of Pakistan, Jinnah co-founded the All Pakistan Women's Association, which helped settle the migrants in the new country. After the death of her brother, she was a prominent philanthropist, but was not politically active until 1965. Then she took part in the Pakistani presidential election against the military Dictator Ayub Khan. She lost the primary because of election rigging by the Pakistan Army.

Her legacy is her support for civil rights, her struggle in Pakistan Movement and her devotion to her brother. Many institutions and public spaces have been named in her honour.
