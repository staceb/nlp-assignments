GMC Envoy

GMC Envoy is a midsize SUV sold by the GMC division of General Motors. It was introduced in 1998. In 2002 the Envoy was improved and rode on the same chassisas the new Chevrolet TrailBlazer. The Envoy was later given an extended wheelbase. In 2004 it was given a trim package called XUV. This was an Envoy XL with no third row seating and a retractable roof over the cargo bay. This was an attempt to make it both an SUV and a pickup truck. The resulting odd-looking Envoy XUV did not sell well. 2009 was the last model year for the Envoy. It had daytime running lights, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes and a rollover sensor that automatically deployed the side curtain air bags. It was replaced by the GMC Terrain.
