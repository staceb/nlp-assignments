Tom O'Carroll

Thomas Victor O'Carroll (born 1945) is an Irish writer. He is an activist for pedophiles. He lives in Cumbria. 

In 1980 O'Carroll's first book, "Paedophilia: The Radical Case", was published. In the book, O'Carroll talks about his own experiences as a pedophile and about how sex between children and adults is not wrong. The book was taken off Amazon in 2010.
In June 2010 "Michael Jackson's Dangerous Liaisons", a book he wrote about Michael Jackson was published under a pen name.

O'Carroll was first jailed in 1981 for the contact ads in the Paedophile Information Exchange's magazine. In August 2002, O'Carroll was imprisoned for nine months, and jailed again in 2006 for two and a half years for having child pornography.
