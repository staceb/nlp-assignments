Virga

In meteorology, virga is precipitation that falls from a cloud but evaporates or sublimes before reaching the ground. It is seen a lot in deserts and temperate climates. These areas have low humidity and high temperatures which cause the rain to evaporate before reaching the ground. In North America, it is seen a lot in the Western United States and the Canadian Prairies. It is also seen a lot in the Middle East and North Africa.
