Andrea Dworkin

Andrea Rita Dworkin (September 26, 1946 – April 9, 2005) was an American radical feminist and writer. Dworkin wrote ten books about radical feminism. She was most famous for saying that pornography hurts the women who participate in it and makes men who watch it believe harmful things about women. Her two most well known books are "Pornography: Men Possessing Women" (1981) and "Intercourse" (1987). In 1986, Dworkin's first novel "Ice and Fire" was published.

In 2000 "Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel And Women's Liberation" was published. The book was inspired by a visit Dworkin made to Israel in 1988.
