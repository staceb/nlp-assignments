Latrell Sprewell

Latrell Sprewell is a retired American professional basketball player. His nickname was "Spree".

He was selected 24th overall in the 1992 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. He started 69 of the 77 games in his rookie season and averaged 15.4 points per game.

During his time as a professional, Sprewell was named to the yearly NBA All-Star game four times. He also helped the New York Knicks reach the NBA Finals and the Minnesota Timberwolves to the Western Conference finals. 

Despite the accomplishments, his career was overshadowed in 1997 because he choked coach P. J. Carlesimo during a practice. Sprewell's career came to an unexpected end in 2005 when he refused a $21-million three-year contract offer from the Timberwolves.
