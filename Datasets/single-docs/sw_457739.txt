In the game, the player controls Bigby Wolf, formerly the Big Bad Wolf. Bigby is the sheriff of Fabletown and works at the "Business Office" under interim mayor Ichabod Crane. He is aided by Snow White and her Magic Mirror during his investigation along with the help of Bufkin the winged monkey who manages the records of Fabletown. Bigby saves a young prostitute from a drunk Woodsman. He leads her to safety and she tells him that he is not as bad as everyone says he is. The next day, Bigby is shocked to find that the woman's head had been left on the Woodlands doorstep. Clues that were left with her head identify her as Faith, a Fable from Allerleirauh. Ichabod Crane then orders that Bigby and Snow White investigate her death.
