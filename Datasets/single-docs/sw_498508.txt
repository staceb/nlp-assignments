Man of Constant Sorrow

"Man of Constant Sorrow" (also known as "I Am a Man of Constant Sorrow") is a traditional American folk song first recorded by Dick Burnett, a partially blind fiddler from Kentucky. The song was originally recorded by Burnett as "Farewell Song" printed in a Richard Burnett songbook, about 1913. 

An early version was recorded by Emry Arthur in 1928 (Vocalion Vo 5208). It became popular again when it was played in the 2000 movie "O Brother, Where Art Thou?".
