Nature photography

Nature photography is photography of natural things such as landscapes, wildlife, and plants. It can include close-ups of natural scenes and textures. Nature photography tends to put a stronger emphasis on making the photo look good than other forms of photography like photojournalism and documentary photography. Nature photographs are published in scientific, travel and cultural magazines.
