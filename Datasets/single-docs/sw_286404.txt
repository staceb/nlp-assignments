Muhammad Hassan

Mark Copani (born November 7, 1981 in Syracuse, New York) is a retired American professional wrestler who is best known for wrestling with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under the ring name, Muhammad Hassan. 

His gimmick was about a Middle Eastern-American wrestler that wanted acceptance from the stereotypes created by the 9/11 attacks. His gimmick got attention from the New York Post, TV Guide, Variety and other news sources because he was supposed to face The Undertaker in a match The Great American Bash and Teddy Long put Hassan's manager, Daivari in a match with The Undertaker on the earlier version of SmackDown.

After Daivari was defeated, Hassan began to pray on the entrance ramp and five masked men came out that were dressed in black shirts, ski-masks, and camo pants. They were armed with clubs and a piano wire and they beat and choked the Undertaker out, and Hassan put him in the Camel Clutch.

Three days later before the episode aired, the London bombings took place and UPN didn't have enough time to edit the segment out of the episode and they showed the unedited version in the United States and Canada but was removed from airing in Australia and Europe.

UPN urged the WWE to remove Hassan's character from television which they succeeded in when Copani was released from his WWE contract on September 21, 2005.
