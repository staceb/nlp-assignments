Indian rhinoceros

The Indian rhinoceros or the Asian one-horned rhinoceros ("Rhinoceros unicornis") is a large mammal primarily found in Pakistan, north-eastern India, Nepal and parts of Bhutan. It lives in the tall grasslands and forests in the foothills of the Himalayas. 

Rhinoceros was hunted for sport, and is now poached because its horn is used for traditional Chinese medicine (alternative medicine).
