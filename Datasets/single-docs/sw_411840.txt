Huun-Huur-Tu

Huun-Huur-Tu (Tuvan: "Хүн Хүртү", "Khün Khürtü") is a music group from Tuva, a Russian Federation republic on the Mongolian border. 

Huun Huur Tu performs throat singing, in which the singers sing more than one note at a time. One of the notes sometimes sounds like a flute, whistle or bird, but is actually a person's voice. 

The group mostly uses native Tuvan instruments such as the "igil", "khomus" (Tuvan jaw harp), "doshpuluur", and "dünggür" (shaman drum). However, in recent years, the group has started using western instruments, such as the guitar. Huun Huur Tu's music is mostly Tuvan folk music, but they also experiment with Western instruments and electronic music.
