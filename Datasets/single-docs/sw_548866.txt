Cheap Thrills

"Cheap Thrills" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Sia. It was recorded for her seventh studio album, "This Is Acting", after it was rejected by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna. On February 11, 2016, the song was released as a remix with Jamaican recording artist Sean Paul.
The remix of the song has been very successful, reaching the top ten in Sia's country of Australia, the top two in the UK, and number one in Canada, most of mainland Europe, and the United States. "Cheap Thrills" became Sia's first "Billboard" Hot 100 number-one hit and Sean Paul's fourth. Sean Paul's last number-one U.S. song was "Temperature" in 2006. She never shows her face or even is in her music videos because of privacy.

The song reached number 11 on the year-end "Billboard" Hot 100 of 2016. It was certified double-Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The remix was nominated for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 2017 (59th) Grammy Awards.
