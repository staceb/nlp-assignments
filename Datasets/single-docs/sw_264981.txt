Centenary Medal

The Centenary Medal is an award given by the Australian Government in 2001. It was set up to celebrate the Centenary of Federation of Australia and to honour people who have made a contribution to Australian society or government. Possible winners were studied by a group headed by the historian Professor Geoffrey Blainey.

The front of the medal has a seven-pointed Commonwealth Star, for the six Australian states, with the seventh point for Australia's territories. At the centre of the star is an image showing the Indigenous Australian traditions at the heart of the continent. Around the edge are 100 dots for 100 years of federation. The other side has a seven pointed star, with the words "For Contribution Made to Australian Society" around the edge.

The colours in the ribbon are crimson, which represents federation, and blue and gold for the beginning of the 21st Century. The seven gold and red lines signify the states' pathways to federation. The bar and ribbon are the same so that a person with the award can be recognized easily.
