Hijra (South Asia)

In the culture of South Asia, hijras are people who were born male who have a feminine gender identity and wear women's clothing. Hijras do not feel male or female. There are hijras in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. The word 'hijra' is often translated into 'Eunuch' or 'Hermaphrodite'. Some Hijras are eunuchs or hermaphrodites. Many are not.

Hijras are discriminated against a lot. Many hijras do sex work because people will not give them jobs. Since November 2013, hijras in Bangladesh have been allowed to choose 'hijra' as a gender on their passports. Before this they had to choose 'male' or 'female'. Hijras have their own language called Hijra Farsi. It is also known as Koti. In 2000, Shabnam Mausi was the first hijra to be elected into Indian parliament.
