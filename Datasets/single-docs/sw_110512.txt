IMac

The iMac is an all-in-one personal computer that was first released in 1998. It is made by Apple Inc.. It has been the main part of Apple's consumer desktop offerings since its debut in August 1998, and has evolved through six distinct forms.

Apple adopted Intel processors which post-2006 Macs now run on. Because Mac OS X was written for PowerPC at the time, Mac OS X ran in an emulation environment called Rosetta. Programs and applications received 'Universal Binary' updates to make them run reliably and use less resources of the Rosetta environment, instead hardware accelerating themselves. 

iMac models after 2001 were shipped with macOS (formerly known as OS X).

The latest macOS version, 10.12 Sierra, is Intel processor dependent. No PowerPC based computer can run or install it meaning most of the iMac line are not 10.11 compatible.

Some of the newest iMac models don't have CD or disc drives.
