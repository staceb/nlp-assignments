York Cottage

York Cottage was the home of King George V and Queen Mary when they were Duke and Duchess of York. It is currently used as the Estate Office for Sandringham House. Some of the building is also used as flats for estate employees and holiday accommodation.

King George V and his wife, Queen Mary, lived in the house after their marriage in 1893.
