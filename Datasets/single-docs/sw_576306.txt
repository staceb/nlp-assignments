RMS Empress of Ireland

The RMS "Empress of Ireland" was a Canadian ocean liner. It sank in the Saint Lawrence River after an accident with the Norwegian ship SS "Storstad" on 29 May 1914. Of the 1,477 people on the "Empress", 1,012 died.

The ship was launched in 1906. It had just begun its 96th voyage when it sank.

The "Empress of Ireland" left Quebec City for Liverpool at 4:30 pm local time.

The wreck of the "Empress of Ireland" lies in 130 feet of water. This makes it easy to access for most divers. Many artifacts from the wreck have been retrieved.
