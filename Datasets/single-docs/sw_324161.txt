Julia set

A Julia set is a fractal. It is a set defined given a rational function (written "J(f)"). The Fatou set of a rational function ("F(f)") is the complementary set of the Julia set of "f". The Fatou set of a function are the values such that all nearby values behave similarly when the function is repeatedly iterated.
