Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever

The Nova Scotia Duck-Tolling Retriever is a breed of sport and hunting dog that originated in Canada in the 19th century to help hunters with attracting ducks within gunshot range and bringing the duck back to the hunter. They stand 17-21 inches (43 to 53 cm) and weigh 43 to 51 pounds (19 to 23 kg). They are the smallest of the retrievers. Its thick coat of fur protects it from the icy cold water.
