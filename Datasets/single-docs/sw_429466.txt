Amygdala

The amygdala is an almond-shaped group of neurons. These groups of neurons in the brain are called "nuclei". 

The word amygdala is derived from the Greek word for almond. The group of neurons is positioned in the temporal lobe of the brain. The amygdala is divided into three different groups: the "basolateral nuclei", the "corticomedial nuclei", and the "central nucleus". The amygdala is related to the processing of emotions, especially fear. It is connected to many other parts of the brain, including the hippocampus and cingulate gyrus. Information from the sensory systems is also fed into the amygdala. This information is fed mostly to the basolateral nuclei of the amygdala.
