Q Awards

The Q Awards are the United Kingdom's annual music awards run by the music magazine Q. Since they began in 1990, the Q Awards have become one of Britain's biggest and most advertised music awards, helped by the often bad behaviour of the celebrities who turn up. In the ceremony of 2004, Elton John accused Madonna of cheating fans by miming on stage, after she had been nominated for a Best Live Act award.
