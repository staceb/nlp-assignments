Lollipop

Lollipops, pops, or lollies are sweet candies you can lick or suck on. There are many flavours of lollipops, including fruits to soft drinks. In Europe, especially the Nordic countries, Germany and the Netherlands, salty-liquorice or salmiak () flavoured lollipops are also available, but these are largely unknown in other parts of the world. With a lot of companies making lollipops, the candy now comes in dozens of flavors and many different shapes. They range from small ones which can be bought by the hundred and are often given away for free at banks, barbershops, etc., to very large ones made out of candy canes twisted into a circle. There are also bacon flavored lollipops.

Some lollipops contain fillings, such as bubble gum or soft candy. 

Some lollipops have been marketed for use as diet aids, although their effectiveness is untested, and anecdotal cases of weight loss may be due to the power of suggestion.
