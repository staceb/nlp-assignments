San Diego Creek

San Diego Creek is a small northwest-flowing river in Orange County, California. It is about long and its watershed covers 112.2 square miles (291 square kilometers) in three cities. Its source is in the Coast Range, but several of its tributaries begin in the Santa Ana Mountains and flow west to the creek. San Diego Creek flows into Upper Newport Bay, a branch of Newport Bay and eventually the Pacific Ocean.
