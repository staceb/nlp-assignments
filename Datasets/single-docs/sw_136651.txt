Frank Wilson

Frank Wilson (12 May 1859 – 7 December 1918) was the 9th Premier of Western Australia from 16 September 1910 until 7 October 1911 and then again from 27 July 1916 until 28 June 1917. He was a member of the various conservative political parties which were formed in Western Australia, including the Liberal Party, the Liberal League, and the Ministerialist Party. He was defeated by the Australian Labor Party in the elections of October 1911. He was able to form a group of anti-labor members in 1916 and become premier a second time. He lost this support when the Country Party was able to form a National Party to support the war effort. He lost his seat in the parliament to the County Party by only four votes in October 1917. Seriously ill with cancer, he died a few months later.
