Pasteurella multocida

Pasteurella multocida is a gram-negative, non-motile coccobacillus that is penicillin-sensitive. "Pasteurella multocida" often exists as a commensal in the upper respiratory tracts of many livestock, poultry, and domestic pet species, especially cats and dogs.

"Pasteurella multocida" was first found in 1878 in fowl cholera-infected birds. However, it was not isolated until 1880 by Louis Pasteur, the man in whose honor "Pasteurella" is named.
