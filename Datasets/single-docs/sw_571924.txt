Harvey Lichtenstein

Harvey Lichtenstein (April 9, 1929 – February 11, 2017) was an American arts administrator.

He was best known for his 32-year tenure (1967–99) as president and executive producer of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, or BAM. He led the institution to a renaissance, championing contemporary performance, establishing the Next Wave Festival, and providing a vital venue for dance, theater, music, and collaborations that bridged disciplines. When Lichtenstein retired, the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation made the decision to honor his considerable accomplishments by foregoing its own naming rights and dedicating the BAM Harvey Theater in his honor.

Lichtenstein was born in Brooklyn, New York. He studied at Brooklyn College and at Black Mountain College. Lichtenstein died in Manhattan, New York on February 11, 2017 from complications of a stroke, aged 87.
