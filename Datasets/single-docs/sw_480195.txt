Muath Al-Kasasbeh

Muath Safi Yousef Al-Kasasbeh (; May 29, 1988 – January 3, 2015) was a Jordanian pilot. He was imprisoned and burnt alive by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

Al-Kasasbeh was a First Lieutenant in the Royal Jordanian Air Force. The plane he was piloting, an F-16 fighter jet, crashed after mechanical problems on December 24, 2014, though Islamic State claimed it shot his aircraft down. He was captured by Islamic State militants near Raqqa, Syria.

He was threatened with execution, but there were negotiations to release him. However, Islamic State decapitated his co-prisoner, Japanese journalist Kenji Goto, and subsequently burned Al-Kasasbeh to death while he was locked in a cage.
