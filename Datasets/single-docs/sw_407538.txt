Adly Mansour

Adly Mahmud Mansour (; born 23 December 1945) is an Egyptian judge. Currently, he is the head of the Supreme Constitutional Court. In July 2013, the military deposed the now former president Mohamed Morsi, and made Mansour the interim President of Egypt. Mass protests which had taken place beforehand prompted this removal. The military made the announcement with several secular and religious leaders, such as Grand Imam of al-Azhar Dr Ahmed el-Tayeb, Coptic Pope Tawadros II and Mohamed ElBaradei. Morsi said that his removal was not valid and continued to maintain that he is the legitimate President of Egypt. Mansour was sworn into office in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court on 4 July 2013.

Mansour graduated in law, from Cairo University. He has done postgraduate education in economics and management science.
