Violin Concerto No. 1 (Bach)

The Violin Concerto No. 1 in A minor, BWV 1042 is a work for solo violin and orchestra. It was written by Johann Sebastian Bach about 1730. It consists of three movements (quick-slow-quick) in imitation of the pattern set by Antonio Vivaldi. The first movement is in quick 2/4 time and written in ritornello structure. The central movement is an aria "without wordslyrical, expressively warm, ever gentle, yet inescapably melancholic..." The last movement is a jig in 3/8 time marked Allegro. Like Bach's two other violin concertos, the solo instrument appears to both compete and cooperate with the orchestra.
