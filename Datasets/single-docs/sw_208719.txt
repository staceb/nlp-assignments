Chet Atkins

Chester Burton "Chet" Atkins (June 20, 1924 – June 30, 2001) was an American guitarist and record producer. He helped create a smooth country music style known as the "Nashville Sound."

His guitar picking style was inspired by Merle Travis, Django Reinhardt and Les Paul and brought him admirers both in the United States and internationally as well as earning him the nickname "Mister Guitar."

Chet Atkins produced records for Perry Como, Elvis Presley, the Everly Brothers, Eddy Arnold, Jim Reeves, Jerry Reed and Waylon Jennings along with many others.

Chet Atkins received many honors including 14 Grammy Awards as well as the "Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award." He won nine Country Music Association "Instrumentalist of the Year" awards, and was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

He died from cancer on June 30, 2001, at his home in Nashville, Tennessee.

In 2002, Atkins was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The following year, Atkins was ranked #28 in CMT's "40 Greatest Men of Country Music."
