Winged Victory of Samothrace

The Winged Victory of Samothrace (or Nike of Samothrace) is a Parian marble sculpture now in the Louvre, Paris, France. It is believed to have been made about 190 BC. It was discovered in 1863. It commemorates the Greek victory in a sea battle near Samothrace. It stands 5.57 m high. The work presents a pose where violent motion and sudden stillness meet. It is notable for its graceful balance and for the rendering of the figure's draped garments, depicted as if rippling in a strong sea breeze.
