Chevrolet Spark

Chevrolet Spark is a city car sold by General Motors. It was first introduced in 1998 as Daewoo Matiz. In 2002 it was redesigned for a second generation. It began to be exported and sold under various names including Chevrolet Joy and Pontiac Matiz. In 2007 the third generation was introduced. It was only sold as Chevrolet and Daewoo. GM plans to stop making the Spark and replace it with a brand new vehicle called the Opel Karl. GM will still use the Spark name in U.S., Korean and Australian markets. Ever since its first generation the Spark is only offered as a 5-door hatchback.
