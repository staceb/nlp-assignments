Farm Sanctuary

Farm Sanctuary is an animal protection organization founded in 1986 by Gene Baur and Lorri Houston. It is the leading shelter for farm animals in the United States. Farm Sanctuary not only provides shelter to injured or endangered farm animals but also supports animal rights. The organization has a history of fighting laws that help the factory farming industry. Farm Sanctuary currently owns and operates three animal shelters in these cities: Watkins Glen, New York, Los Angeles, California and Orland, California. Combined, these locations house over 1000 farm animals, including chickens, cows, sheep, goats, pigs, ducks, rabbits, and geese. Various books about Farm Sanctuary have been written by co-founder Gene Baur. These include "Farm Sanctuary: Changing Hearts and Minds About Animals and Food" and "Living the Farm Sanctuary Life: The Ultimate Guide to Eating Mindfully, Living Longer, and Feeling Better Every Day". Both of these books reached bestseller lists and have received national attention.
