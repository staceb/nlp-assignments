Mr. Trash Wheel

Mr. Trash Wheel also known as the Inner Harbor Trash Wheel, is a trash interceptor. It removes trash from the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, Maryland. It is powered by water and solar power. It moves through the water and sorts trash into a conveyor belt that empties it into a dumpster on the vessel.

Mr. Trash Wheel removes garbage from the Inner Harbor. The garbage comes from the streets flowing into the water, particularly during storms. Usually the current from the Jones Falls river powers the wheel's movement. When the stream is slow it is powered by solar panels.
