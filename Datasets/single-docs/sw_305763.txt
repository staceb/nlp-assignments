whilst further to the south are the small and isolated islands of Værøy and Røst. The total land area amounts to 1,227 km², and the population totals 24,500.

Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago is the vast, open Vestfjord, and to the north is Vesterålen. The main towns in Lofoten are Leknes in Vestvågøy and Svolvær in Vågan.
