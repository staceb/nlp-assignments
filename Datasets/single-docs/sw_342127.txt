Phytoremediation

Phytoremediation is fixing environmental problems through the use of plants.
A type of this is "phytomining", which is a method of extraction. Some plants absorb copper compounds through their roots. They concentrate these compounds as a result of this. The plants can be burned to produce an ash that contains the copper compounds.
