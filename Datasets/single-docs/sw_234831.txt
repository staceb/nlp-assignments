Enthronement

An enthronement is a ceremony of inauguration, involving a person —usually a monarch or religious leader — who is formally seated for the first time upon a throne. 

The throne is seen as a symbol of authority.

This ritual is different from a coronation because there is no crown. However, the term "coronation" and the term "enthronement" are often used to mean the same thing.
