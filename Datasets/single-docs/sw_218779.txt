Karolinska Institutet

Karolinska Institutet (in English Karolinska Institute), and before 1968, the Royal Caroline Institute is one of Europe's biggest medical universities.

It was started in 1810 on Kungsholmen island on the west side of Stockholm. It later moved to Solna, just outside Stockholm, and a second campus has been built in Flemingsberg/Huddinge, south of Stockholm.

A committee of the institute decides on the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

The Karolinska University Hospital, in Solna and Huddinge, is the university's research and teaching hospital. It is one of Sweden's largest centres for training and research, with 30 percent of the medical training and 40 percent of the medical academic research. While most of the medical programs are taught in Swedish, most of the Ph.D. programs are taught in English.

The institute is a member of the League of European Research Universities. In the 2009 Academic Ranking of World Universities, the institute is the best university for medicine and pharmacy in Europe, 8th in the world. It is listed as the best university in Sweden.

Karolinska Institutet was started between 1810 and 1811 to teach army surgeons. It was called the 'Medico-Chirurgiska Institutet'.

In 1817 the name 'Karolinska' was added as a reference to 'Karoliner' which was the name of soldiers under the Swedish king Karl XII. The full name became 'Kongl. Carolinska Medico Chirurgiska Institutet'.

In 1968 this name was changed to 'Karolinska Institutet'.
