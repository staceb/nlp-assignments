Berga (Spain, Catalonia)

Berga is the capital of the "comarca" (county) of Berguedà, in Catalonia, northeast Spain.

Berga name is from the Bergistani, an Iberian tribe who lived in the area before the Roman conquest. Berga was ruled by viscounts in the Early Middle Ages. It had its own counts starting in 988. Berga was sold to King Peter II of Aragon in 1199.

Berga is perhaps most famous for its traditional festival of "La Patum". The celebration occurs every Corpus Christi, lasting for five days.
