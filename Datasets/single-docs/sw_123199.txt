Shingo La Pass

Shingo-la is a mountain pass in Jammu and Kashmir, on the border between Jammu and Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh (Republic of India). There is a shallow lake or pool about 20m below the pass. The pass is on a footpath linking Zanskar and Lahaul, used often by locals and trekkers alike. For trekkers it is one of the technically easiest 5000m passes in Indian Himalaya, involving no glacier trekking nor steep climbs. There is snow on the pass all year round. In the summer, only a small stretch of snow has to be passed.
