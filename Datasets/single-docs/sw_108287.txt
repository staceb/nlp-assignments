Prajna

Prajna is a Buddhist word meaning wisdom. It is one of three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path. The understanding is a goal of contemplation. Buddhism traces its origins to Siddattha Gotama, who lived from about 563 to 483 BCE. He was known as the Buddha, which means "the enlightened one".
