Jersey (fabric)

Jersey is a type of fabric which is mainly used for clothing. Originally it was made of wool, but today other materials, such as cotton or synthetic fibers are also used. Since the Middle Ages, the island of Jersey exported a lot of knitted goods; the fabric used became well-known under the name.
