Meehanite

Meehanite is a form of iron made through a process invented by Meehanite Worldwide. When a foundry produces Meehanite, it means that Meehanite Worldwide has allowed them to use their method.

The process was invented in the 1930's when the founder of Meehanite Worldwide discovered you can use Calcium Silicide to make very pure iron.
