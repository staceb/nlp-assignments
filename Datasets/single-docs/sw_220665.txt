Cream pie

A cream pie is a type of pie filled with a rich custard or pudding that is made from milk, cream, flour, and eggs. It can come in many forms, like vanilla, lemon, lime, banana, coconut, and chocolate. A common feature of all cream pies is the whipped cream topping. The pudding-like filling is related to the French crème patissière which is a main ingredient of many French cakes and tarts.
