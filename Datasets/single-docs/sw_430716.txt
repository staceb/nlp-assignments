Low voltage ride through

Low voltage ride through (LVRT) is the capability of an electrical device to function normally during periods of low voltage. Many electrical devices in general must have a minimum amount of voltage for them to be able to work. If the voltage is too low the equipment will not work correctly or the efficiency will be reduced.
