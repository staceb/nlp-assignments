Christian terrorism

Christian terrorism is a form of terrorism where the terrorists claim their motivations lie in their Christian religion. Very often, such groups use the Old Testament or the New Testament scriptures to legitimize their actions. Sometimes, the religious violence arises from different Christian groups fighting for dominance.
