Pontiac Sunfire

The Pontiac Sunfire was a car produced by Pontiac from 1995 through 2005. The Sunfire succeeded the Pontiac Sunbird and was succeeded by the Pontiac G5 (a rebadged Chevrolet Cobalt). The Sunfire was also purchased in a sedan, convertible or coupe. Much like its twin the Cavalier the Sunfire also fared poor in the offset test by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.

The first Pontiac Sunfire became the successor of the Pontiac Sunbird after it got cancelled in 1990s. The Pontiac received a minor facelift in the early 2000s.
