FreeRice

FreeRice is a non-profit organization that donates rice to the hungry people around the world. Players choose an answer from a multiple-choice question. As the player gets more right answers, they advance in level. The highest level depends on the subject.

In 2008, FreeRice became economically sufficient to donate 20 grains of rice per answer instead of 10. Unfortunately, the economic landslide of 2009 reduced the grains per answer back down to 10.
