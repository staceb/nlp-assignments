Jura Mountains

The Jura Hills are a long mountain arc. The Jura rock or stone consists of limestone. It reaches from Lake Geneva to the Rhine River. The Jura Hills are not only in Switzerland, but also in France. The Chasseral is one of the highest hills in the Jura Mountains. It has an altitude of 1607 metres above sea level. The highest part of the Jura Hills is the “Crêt de la Neige“ in France and it is 1718 metres high. Many fossils and dinosaur tracks have been found there. The rocks of the Jura were formed between 144 million and 208 million years ago. The agriculture and winter tourism are very important for the principal economics.
