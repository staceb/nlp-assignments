Headshot

A headshot (or head shot) is a photograph of a person's face. It is a form of portraiture. The purpose of a headshot is to show the subject's personality, or character. Headshots are used in the modelling and acting businesses and is vital to the careers of many business and sales executives who use them on business cards, company web sites and social media sites like LinkedIn. Most actors have a headshot that they will provide to employers.

Headshots are a separate specialty career path branch for several photographers who make or have made careers in this kind of photography. Examples include Yousuf Karsh (1908-2002), Yucel Yalim (1958) and Peter Hurley.
