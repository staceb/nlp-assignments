Datsik (musician)

Datsik (real name: Troy Beetles) (born June 9, 1988 in Kelowna, British Columbia) is a dubstep DJ and music producer. 

Datsik started producing dubstep after he heard his friend Excision play at the Shambhala Music Festival in 2008. The name Datsik was inspired by Beetles' former Xbox Live gamertag. He started his own record label called Firepower Records in early 2012. He released his debut studio album titled, Vitamin D on April 10, 2012. He is known to work frequently with fellow Canadian producers Excision and Downlink.
