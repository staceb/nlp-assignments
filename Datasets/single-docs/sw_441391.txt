The Path to 9/11

The Path to 9/11 is a melodramatic, event-based television movie. It is about the events between the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and the few minutes just after the September 11 attacks. The movie was criticized for saying untrue things about events and some people and for not showing all sides of things.

The cast includes Patricia Heaton, Harvey Keitel and Donnie Wahlberg. Keitel was warned that some things in the movie were not true. When the TV network was trying to fix the issue, however, it was too late. There were arguments on what was true or untrue.

This movie aired in two parts in September 2006 on the ABC Network.
