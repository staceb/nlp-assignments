Longsword

The longsword is a European sword. It was mainly used during the medieval and renaissance periods, about 1350 to 1550 AD. Early and late use is known in the 13th and 17th centuries.

The longsword has a long blade, but also a long grip, which means it is a weapon designed for two-handed use.
