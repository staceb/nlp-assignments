Comedytime Saturday

"Comedytime Saturday" is the official branding for a one-hour programming block in the 2011-12 television season on CBS. It airs reruns of shows on Thursdays and Mondays on CBS. "How to Be a Gentleman" was moved on this block when episodes got burned off, and "Rules of Engagement" moved to its timeslot (Thursdays at 8:30 PM).
