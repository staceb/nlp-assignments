Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)

The Sabine River is a river that starts in Texas, and flows into the Gulf of Mexico in Louisiana. It forms some of the lower part of the border of Louisiana-Texas. The Sabine State Bank is named after the river. The name Sabine comes from the Spanish word for cypress, because of the bald cypresses along the lower part of the Sabine.
