Because of You

"Because of You" is a pop rock single from singer Kelly Clarkson off her second studio album "Breakaway". It was first released in 2005. The single made Clarkson the only winner in "American Idol" history to have a fourth song from the same album in Top 10 on the "Billboard" Hot 100. In 2007 "Because of You" was reprised in a duet alongside the country music artist Reba McEntire; the reprised version produced the first appearance of Clarkson in the Billboard Hot Country charts, where the single hit Number 2.
