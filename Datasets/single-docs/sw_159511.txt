London Underground 1992 Stock

The 1992 Tube Stock is the type of train used on the Central line and Waterloo & City line of the London Underground. The trains were built by BREL (later Adtranz and now Bombardier Transportation). They were built after three 1986 tube stock prototype trains were tested to find out what the public wanted on the new trains.
