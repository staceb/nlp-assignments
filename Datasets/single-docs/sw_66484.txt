Kidnapping

Kidnapping is an illegal act of stealing people. It has been around for a long time. For example, there were slave traders in Ancient Rome who kidnapped people and sold them as slaves. If a parent steals a child without the other parent's consent it is known as parental abduction. Sometimes kidnapping is done for ransom.
