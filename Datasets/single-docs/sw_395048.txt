The other members were Julián Bautista, Ernesto Halffter and his brother Rodolfo, Juan José Mantecón, Fernando Remacha, Salvador Bacarisse and Jesús Bal y Gay. She married Bal y Gay in 1933. Her more notable compositions include "Suite para orquesta (Suite for orchestra)", "Preludio (Prelude)", and the "Concierto para piano y orquesta (Concerto for piano and orchestra)".
