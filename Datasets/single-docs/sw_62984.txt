Laboratory glassware

Laboratory glassware refers to various items which are usually made of glass and used for scientific work in chemistry and biology laboratories. Some of these items are now made of plastic which is less expensive and more convenient.

Pipettes, petri dishes, and test tubes are examples of laboratory glassware. These items are used to store materials, to measure their volume, to mix and prepare solutions, or to contain a chemical reaction.
