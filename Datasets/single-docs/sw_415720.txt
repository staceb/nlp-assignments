Transkei

The Transkei (meaning "the area beyond the river Kei"), officially the Republic of Transkei was a Bantustan—an area for members of a specific ethnicity. It was in the southeastern region of South Africa. Its capital was Umtata (renamed Mthatha in 2004). President of South Africa Nelson Mandela was born here.
