Andrew Vowles

Andrew Lee Isaac Vowles (born 10 November 1967, Southmead Hospital, Bristol, England), also known as Mushroom, is a founding member of British trip-hop band Massive Attack.

Vowles grew up in Bath. The same time to Massive Attack, Vowles, along with Robert Del Naja, Grant Marshall, Nellee Hooper, and others were The Wild Bunch crew, named after a western by Sam Peckinpah. Several members of The Wild Bunch formed Massive Attack.

Vowles stayed a member of Massive Attack until shortly after the release of their third full-length album, "Mezzanine", in 1998. Interviews with band members have pointed to differences of opinion in the direction the band should go; Vowles liking a hip-hop direction while Robert Del Naja and Daddy G leaned more towards darker electronica themes. He also had expressed a dislike for touring, an activity which he characterised as "pimping".
