Dio Chrysostom

Dio Chrysostom () was a Greek speaker, writer, philosopher and historian of the Roman Empire. He lived in the 1st century, from about the year 40 to around the year 115. He is also known as Dion of Prusa or Dio Cocceianus. Eighty of his "Discourses" (or "Orations") are known. A few Letters and a funny mock essay In Praise of Hair, as well as a few other fragments also survive. His surname "Chrysostom" comes from the Greek "chrysostomos", which literally means "golden-mouthed". He should not be confused with the Roman historian Cassius Dio, nor with the 4th-century bishop John Chrysostom of Constantinople.
