Adenoid

Adenoids (also called pharyngeal tonsils, or nasopharyngeal tonsils) are tissues at the very back of the nose. They are in the part of the nose where is joins the mouth.

In most children they make a soft bump on the top and back section of the nose's air passage.

Taking away adenoids with surgery is called adenoidectomy.
