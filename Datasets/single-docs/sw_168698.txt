Saint Veronica

Saint Veronica or Berenice, according to the ""Acta Sanctorum"" published by the Bollandists (under February 4), was a pious woman of Jerusalem. She moved with pity as Jesus carried his cross to Golgotha, gave him her veil that he might wipe his forehead. Jesus accepted the offering and after using it handed it back to her, the image of his face miraculously impressed upon it.
