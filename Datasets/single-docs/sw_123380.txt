Shipki La Pass

Shipkila is a mountain pass and border post on the Republic of India-People's Republic of China border. It is through this pass which the river Sutlej enters India (from the Tibet Autonomous Region).

It is located in Kinnaur District in the state of Himachal Pradesh, India, and Tibet Autonomous provincial Region in People's Republic of China. The mountainous pass is India's third border post for trade with China after Nathula in occupied Sikkim, and Lipulekh in Uttarakhand. The pass is close to town of Khab. Like other border passes along the Indo-Sino disputed border, it is cliamed by the Chinese and the border because of this is now no longer open for non-residents.
