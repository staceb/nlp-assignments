Stitching awl

A stitching awl is a simple tool to punch holes in leather or other material. It can also be used to make holes larger. 

The awl is used for sewing leather or canvas. It has a thin, tapered metal shaft, coming to a sharp point, either straight or slightly bent. These shafts usually have an eye piercing at the pointed end. This helps to draw thread through holes for lock stitch sewing by hand. They are also called sewing awls.
