Covenant

A covenant is a formal agreement, a promise made between two people. It is often used as a religious promise. It can also be an item which is a symbol of keeping the promise. Some covenants include stone tablets, written documents, and other sacred items. In Judaism, the Ark of the Covenant was a wooden box which held the stone tablets with the Ten Commandments written on them. The Jewish people saw the box as a symbol of God being with them and leading them.
