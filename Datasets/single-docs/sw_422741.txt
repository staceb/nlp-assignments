The Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills (Ofsted) inspects all state schools in England. It writes reports about how good they are. It is funded by the government. It is organised under the Education (Schools) Act 1992. Michael Wilshaw is the head. It hires Additional Inspectors (AI) who do most of the inspections. It also hires Her Majesty's Inspectors (HMI) who come to 6-7% of inspections.

Ofsted's main office is on Kingsway, in central London.
