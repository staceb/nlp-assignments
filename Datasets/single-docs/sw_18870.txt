La Marseillaise

La Marseillaise is the national anthem of France.

It was written by Rouget de Lisle in Strasbourg on April 26, 1792. It was first called ""Chant de guerre pour l'armée du Rhin"" ("Marching Song of the Rhine Army").

Composers have often quoted La Marseillaise in their music, for example Tchaikovsky uses it in the 1812 overture.
