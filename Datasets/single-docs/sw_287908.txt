Edelweiss

Edelweiss is a well-known Europe mountain flower.

Leaves and flowers are covered with white hairs and look woolly. Each Edelweiss bloom has five to six small yellow flower heads surrounded by leaflets in a star shape. The flowers are in bloom between July and September.

The Edelweiss prefers rocky limestone places. It has been used traditionally in folk medicine. The hair on the flower protect the Edelweiss from cold.
