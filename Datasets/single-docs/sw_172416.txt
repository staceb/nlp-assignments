Dracaena (plant)

Dracaena is a genus of about 40 trees and succulent shrubs. The name comes from Ancient Greek "drakaina", meaning female dragon. Most of them are native to tropical Africa, some occur in Southeast Asia, and tropical South America. They are usually classified into "Dragon trees" and "shrubby dracenas" according to how they grow; the latter are also often grown as house plants.
