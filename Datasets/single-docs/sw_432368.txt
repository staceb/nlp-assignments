Ovo-lacto vegetarianism

Ovo-lacto vegetarianism (alternate: lacto-ovo) is a diet in which people do not eat the flesh of animals. They do, though, eat eggs and dairy. Ovo-lacto vegetarians are the most prevalent types in the Western world. Such people are well served in restaurants, especially in certain parts of Europe and in North America.

Ovo-lacto vegetarians use this diet sometimes for religious reasons. Others use it for health.
