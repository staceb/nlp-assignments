David Brown (July 28, 1916 – February 1, 2010) was an American movie producer. Brown and business partner Richard D. Zanuck were one of the most successful producers in Hollywood in the 1960s and in the 1970s.

Brown was born in New York City, the son of Lillian (née Baren) and Edward Fisher Brown. He was best known as the producing partner of Richard D. Zanuck. They were jointly awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1990 for their achievements in producing. Among their films were Steven Spielberg's "Jaws" (1975), and other box office hits such as "Cocoon" (1985), "Driving Miss Daisy" (1989) and "A Few Good Men" (1992).

Brown had one son (Bruce, from an earlier marriage) who died before him, and a half brother (Edward Fisher Brown Jr.).
Brown authored "Brown's Guide to the Good Life: Tears, Fears, and Boredom", which gives advice on life. He also wrote "Let Me Entertain You", an anecdotal auto-biography.

Brown died at his home in Manhattan from renal failure on February 1, 2010, at the age of 93.
