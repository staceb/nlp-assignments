Magnetostatic loudspeaker

A magnetostatic loudspeaker is a dipole speaker. It is quite similar than electrostatic loudspeaker but it doesn't use high voltages, it uses high currents.

The impedance of a magnetostatic speaker may be so low that an amplifier has to be ready to feed low impedance. Sound quality about current speaker type is respected.
