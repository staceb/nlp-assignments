Winton, Victoria

Winton is a small town nine kilometres north east of Benalla, Victoria. About 2,800 people live in the town and the other small towns in the area. It is home to the Winton Motor Raceway, a three kilometre motor racing track. Winton was first settled in 1853, and the town was surveyed in 1857. The Hume Highway from Melbourne to Sydney passed through the town, but the Hume Freeway bypassed Winton in 1987.
