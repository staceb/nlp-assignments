Ranma Saotome is the main character, who is 16 and good at martial arts. He learned from his father, a martial artist. Ranma was training with his father, Genma Saotome, when he falls into a spring which turns him into a girl from then on whenever cold water is poured on him. Genma fell into the spring of the panda, so he turns into a panda. Hot water makes them turn back.

After this both visit Soun Tendo, Genma's friend from a long time ago and his fighting partner. Soun teaches at his martial arts school. Soun tells Genma that he needs a grandchild to carry on the school, so he needs his daughter, Akane Tendo, to marry to get a child, who would receive an inheritance from him. Genma then says that Akane could marry Ranma, and so they become engaged.
