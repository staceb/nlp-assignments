Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (which is known as SNAP) is a food assistance program in the United States. It supplies food for no-income or low-income people. Hot foods are not included. The program was originally called Food Stamp Program. It was renamed in 2008 through farm bills. The term EBT is often used.

During fiscal year 2012, close to $75 billion for assistance in food was distributed. As of September 2012, almost 48 million people received benefits. The average amount was less than $135 per month. Some states get more food assistance than other states.
