Gheorghe Gușet

Gheorghe Guşet (28 May 1968 – 12 June 2017) was a Romanian shot putter. He competed at the 1992, 2000 and 2004 Olympics and had his best result in 2004, aged 36 (14th place). Guşet was noted for being competitive in his late 30s, and set his all-time personal record aged 38, while most shot putters peak in their late 20s or early 30s. Due to health problems (chronic kidney disease) he was forced to retire from competitions in 2008.

Guşet died on 12 June 2017 in Cluj Napoca, Romania from an aortic dissection at the age of 49.
