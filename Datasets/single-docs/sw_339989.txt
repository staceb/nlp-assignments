It airs on ABC. It takes place in Times Square on December 31 of every year. It shows the yearly New Year's Eve ball drop. On December 31, 2004, Regis Philbin hosted the show because of Clark's stroke. The show has been hosted by Ryan Seacrest on New Year's Eve since December 31, 2005. Seacrest hosted with Clark until Clark's death in 2012. 

Singer-songwriter Fergie and actress Jenny McCarthy have reported for this show from Los Angeles and Times Square, respectively. 

In the December 31, 1999 show, it was called "ABC 2000 Today" because 2000 would mark a new millennium. Peter Jennings hosted this show.
