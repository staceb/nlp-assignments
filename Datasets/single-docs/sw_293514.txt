Funk rock

Funk rock (also typed as funk-rock) is a music genre that fuses funk and rock elements.
Its earliest incarnation was heard in the late 1960s through the mid-1970s by acts such as the Jimi Hendrix Experience (last two albums), Eric Burdon and War, Trapeze, Parliament-Funkadelic, Betty Davis and Mother's Finest. In the 1990s acts such as Prince, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Rage Against the Machine and Faith No More revived the genre.

Funk rock is a fusion of funk and rock. Many instruments may be incorporated into the music, but the overall sound is defined by a definitive bass or drum beat and electric guitars. The bass and drum rhythms are influenced by funk music but with more intensity, while the guitar can be funk-or-rock-influenced, usually with distortion, which is similar to overdrive or fuzz.
