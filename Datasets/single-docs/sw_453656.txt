Twisted Metal is a vehicular combat video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment with product development by Sony Interactive Studios America and regular development by SingleTrac. It is the first game in the "Twisted Metal" series. It was released for the PlayStation and on the PlayStation Network.

It was released on November 5, 1995 in North America, January 16, 1996 in Europe, and on November 15, 1996 in Japan. It was also released on February 23, 2011 on the PlayStation Network. In the game, there is a competition where opponents face each other with different kinds of modified vehicles. The object of the game is to destroy their vehicles and be the last one standing. The winner meets Calypso, a mysterious man who grants them a wish. 

IGN rated the game a 7 out of 10 and said ""The game's only downfall is that it's just too short. The game can be completed in just a couple of hours. However, the two-player split-screen combat mode more than makes up for the one-player mode's lack of length."" The game was successful and sold over 1.08 million copies in the United States alone.
