Soccer mom

In America, a soccer mom is a middle-class woman in the suburbs who spends a lot of time taking her school-aged children to sports events and other activities. The soccer mom often drives a minivan, SUV or station wagon. Soccer moms are often completely involved and coach their children from the sidelines.The term "soccer mom" dates back to the early or mid 1980s. The term became more popular when newspapers began using it a lot in 1994 or 1995. It became very popular around 1996, when politicians were constantly using it during the presidential election of 1996, including then-President Bill Clinton.
