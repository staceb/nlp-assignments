This Is What You Came For

"This Is What You Came For" is a song written and produced by Scottish DJ Calvin Harris. It features Rihanna. The song was released on May 1, 2016, via digital outlets. The song has reached number one in Canada and Australia, number two in the United Kingdom, and the top five in the United States. In the U.S., "This Is What You Came For" entered the "Billboard" Hot 100 chart at number nine. It later reached number three there and was certified triple-Platinum by the RIAA. The song is Rihanna's 28th top-ten song in the U.S. The song reached number 17 on the year-end Hot 100 of 2016 in the US.

Harris' ex-girlfriend, American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, co-wrote the song under the name Nils Sjöberg. BMI, which publishes a list of songwriting credits, changed the name to Swift's real name.

The music video for the song was released at midnight (Eastern daylight time) on June 17, 2016. It shows Rihanna wearing a black ponytail and a large gray sweater. She dances inside of a white cube with changing backgrounds. The scenes of fields are similar to those that are in the music video for "We Found Love", which is also a collaboration between Rihanna and Harris. Some critics viewed the changing colors and cube background to be similar to the music video for Canadian rapper Drake's 2015 single "Hotline Bling".

The music video won the award for Best Male Video at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2016.
