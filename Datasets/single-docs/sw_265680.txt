Western Grebe

The Western Grebe is a species of Grebe, or bird. They are well known for their dancing on the top of the water in their early nesting season after mating. The two birds will hold long strands of grass or straw in their bills and dance a dance called "weed dancing". Then, at the climax, they rise and make a pose, which is called rushing, and run across the water's surface for a little bit before they dive. Males also used this dance when they wanted to protect their territories or fight over the female.
