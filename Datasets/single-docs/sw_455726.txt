Daniel Bovet

Daniel Bovet (23 March 1907 – 8 April 1992) is an Swiss-born Italian pharmacologist.

Bovet won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1957 "for his discoveries relating to synthetic compounds that inhibit the action of certain body substances, and especially their action on the vascular system and the skeletal muscles".

In 1965, he was the leader of a study team which came to the conclusion that smoking of tobacco cigarettes increased users' intelligence. He later told The New York Times that the objective was not to "create geniuses, but only [to] put the less-endowed individual in a position to reach a satisfactory mental and intellectual development".
