The Nutcracker and the Mouse King

"The Nutcracker and the Mouse King" () is a story written in 1816 by E. T. A. Hoffmann. It is about a little girl who travels to the Land of Sweets with a Nutcracker Prince. In 1892, the Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and choreographers Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov turned Alexandre Dumas, père's adaptation of the story into the ballet "The Nutcracker". The ballet became one of Tchaikovsky's most famous compositions, and perhaps the most popular ballet in the world.
