The Baharna (singular Bahrani) are the people of the archipelago of Bahrain and the oasis of Qatif on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia. The term is sometimes also given to the Shi'a people of the al-Hasa oasis. They are all Arabic speaking. They claim descent from Arab tribes. Their dialect of Arabic is known as "Bahrani" or "Bahrani Arabic". Almost all follow Shia Islam.
