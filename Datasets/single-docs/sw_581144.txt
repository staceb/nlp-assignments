Early Japanese iron-working techniques

In Japan, blast furnaces were invented very early. So Japan was able to make very pure iron earlier than other countries, which would still be using bloomeries. Their furnaces, called "tataras" were able to make steel and wrought iron. The design of tataras was probably taken from Korea.
