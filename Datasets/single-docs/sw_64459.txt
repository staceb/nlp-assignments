Emerald

An emerald is a mineral gemstone and a variety of beryl. It is the birthstone of someone whose birthday is in the month of May. It is a green crystal. The emerald is one of the most valuable gems, along with the ruby, the opal, topaz, the diamond, and a sapphire.

The word "emerald" comes from Vulgar Latin. The word was Esmaralda/Esmaraldus, a different way of saying the Latin word "Smaragdus", which came from the Greek, ("smaragdos"; "green gem"). It first came from a Semitic word, "izmargad" (). This meant "emerald" or "green". The name could also be related to the Semitic word baraq (בָּרָק ;البُراق; "lightning" or "shine") (c.f. "bareqeth" and , "barq", "lightning"). It is where the Persian ( "zomorrod"), Turkish (), Sanskrit ( "maragdam") and Russian (; "izumrúd") words came from.
