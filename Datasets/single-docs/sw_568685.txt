Oberstaufen

Oberstaufen is a municipality in the district of Oberallgäu in Schwaben, Bavaria, Germany. It is on the B 308 road from Lindau to Immenstadt. 

It is first mentioned as "Stoufun" in AD 868. It was originally part of Swabia. It joined Bavaria in 1805 with the Peace of Pressburg.

Oberstaufen was the first town in Germany to be on Google Street View. This was because of a marketing campaign by the Oberstaufen tourist industry.
