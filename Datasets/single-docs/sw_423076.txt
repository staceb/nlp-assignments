Nieuport 11

The Nieuport 11 is a French single-engine biplane fighter aircraft used during World War I that allowed France to defeat the German Fokker Eindeckers. 
It sometimes called "Bébé" (the French word for "baby") due to its small size.
A more powerful version, the Nieuport 16 was also built, leading to a series of fighters that served into the 1920s.
