Dean Edwards

Dean Edwards (born July 30, 1970) is an American actor and comedian. Edwards joined the cast of "Saturday Night Live" in 2001. He created several impressions. These include Michael Jackson, Wayne Brady, Chris Tucker, Don Cheadle, Colin Powell, Serena Williams, Nipsey Russell, Denzel Washington, Grace Jones, and Billy Ocean. Chris Tucker was Edwards' first impression. This was also the an impression done by Jay Pharoah on his first "SNL" episode on September 25, 2010. Even though Edwards was very good at impressions, he was not used much during his time working on the program. He left after the program's 28th season. He said it was because of creative differences. He also appeared in "Tony N' Tina's Wedding", "The Sopranos", "Robotomy", and "Scared Shrekless". In "Scared Shrekless" and "Thriller Night", he voiced the part of Donkey.

Many feel that Edwards voice and style is very similar to that of Eddie Murphy. 
On YouTube, Edwards currently has his own channel known as "deanedwardscomedy".
