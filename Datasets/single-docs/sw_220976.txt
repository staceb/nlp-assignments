Ouranosaurus

Ouranosaurus was a sail-backed, plant-eating, iguanodontid dinosaur from the Lower Cretaceous period. It was about 24 feet (7 m) long and may have weighed about 4 tons.

Two almost complete "Ouranosaurus" fossils were found in the southern Sahara Desert, in northeast Niger, in 1966. "Spinosaurus", a large, sail-backed meat-eater, was one of its contemporaries in the hot, Cretaceous environment of north Africa. "Ouranosaurus" was named by the French paleontologist Phillippe Taquet in 1976.
