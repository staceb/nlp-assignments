BBC Online

BBC Online (which used to be called bbc.co.uk) is the website for the BBC's UK online services. It is currently the 4th most popular web service in the UK, and includes features such as BBC News, BBC Sport, BBC Weather, BBC iPlayer and learning services such as "Bitesize". The BBC has had a website for information about its TV and radio programmes since 1994, but did not launch officially as BBC Online until December 1997, following government approval to fund it by TV licence fee. The website address was registered in 1991.
