Night of the Ghouls

Night of the Ghouls is a 1959 horror movie written, directed, and produced by Ed Wood. It is a sequel of sorts to Wood's 1955 horror movie, "Bride of the Monster". 

The story is about a crook, Dr. Acula, who pretends to be able to contact the dead. He charges people large amounts of money to speak to their dead relatives. He summons a group of real ghosts who bury him alive. 

The movie stars Kenne Duncan as Dr. Karl Acula, Duke Moore as Lt. Dan Bradford, Tor Johnson as Lobo, Valda Hansen as Sheila, Paul Marco as Patrolman Kelton, and Criswell as himself.
