Shipbuilding

Shipbuilding refers to the manufacturing of ships. In the past many ships were built in places like Glasgow and Sunderland but in the 21st century this industry is not big in the United Kingdom and most ships are built in South Korea and China. Japan once built the most ships but is now in 3rd place.
