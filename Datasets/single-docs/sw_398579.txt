Henrieta Farkašová

Henrieta Farkašová (born May 23, 1986) is a skier from Slovakia. She has a disability: she cannot see everything. She skied at the 2011 IPC Alpine Skiing World Championships. She was the first skier to finish the women's visually impaired downhill race, slalom race, giant slalom race and super combined race. Because she cannot see, Natália Šubrtová was her guide and told her where to go when going down the mountain.
