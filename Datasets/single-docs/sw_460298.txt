Chiffon

Chiffon is a lightweight, plain-woven sheer fabric. The fabric is woven of S and Z twist crepe yarns. The twist in the crepe yarns puckers the fabric in both directions. 

Chiffon is made from cotton, silk or synthetic fibers.

Gowns, lingerie, scarves and other clothing can be made of chiffon.
