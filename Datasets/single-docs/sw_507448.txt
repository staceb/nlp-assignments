WCSH

WCSH is the NBC television station for Southern Maine as well as Eastern and Northern New Hampshire. Its studios are in Portland. It broadcasts a high definition digital signal on UHF channel 44 from a transmitter on Winn Mountain in Sebago, Maine. It is owned by the Gannett Company.

The station airs syndicated programs including: "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire", "The Doctors", "Rachael Ray" and "Inside Edition".

WCSH is the sister station to Maine's other NBC affiliate, WLBZ in Bangor. The twin stations run much of the same programming. Syndicated programming shown only on WCSH includes "The Andy Griffith Show". WLBZ also airs separate station identifications and advertising. With the two stations essentially operating as one, they give statewide coverage not offered by any other channels in Maine.
