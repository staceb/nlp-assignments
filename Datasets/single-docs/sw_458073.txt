Room a Thousand Years Wide

"Room a Thousand Years Wide" is the first single off American rock band Soundgarden's third studio album "Badmotorfinger". The song was released on September 1, 1990.

The song is one of the few songs written that did not have any input from frontman Chris Cornell. The lyrics for the song were written by guitarist Kim Thayil and the music was written by drummer Matt Cameron.

Lead guitarist Kim Thayil said of the song: 
I really liked the music to the song and it needed words, and since no one else pursued it, I decided to. It's not really about things that have actually happened to me. It's more about experience in general. I've heard a lot of good ideas from people telling me what it's about. They said it's about God, Satan, Jesus, Satan, both, it's religious, it isn't religious...The truth is, it's just me.
