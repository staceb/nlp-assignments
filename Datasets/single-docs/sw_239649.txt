Bible translations

The Bible has been translated into many languages. It was originally written in the languages of Aramaic and Hebrew (Old Testament) and Greek (New Testament).

The Latin Vulgate was common in Western Christianity through the Middle Ages. Since then, the Bible has been translated into many more languages. Translations of the Bible into English have a rich and varied history of more than a millennium. Extensive translations into Middle English began in the 14th century with the work of John Wycliffe and his associates. It was fiercely opposed by the Roman Catholic Church. The authorized King James Version later became the standard translation into English.
