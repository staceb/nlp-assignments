2017 Congressional baseball shooting

On June 14, 2017, in Alexandria, Virginia, James Thomas Hodgkinson opened fire on several Republican members of Congress and their staffers, who were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game scheduled for the next day. 

A ten-minute shootout ensued between Hodgkinson and officers from the Capitol Police and Alexandria Police. Hodgkinskon shot five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R–LA) and two Capitol Police officers assigned to protect him; one of the officers shot Hodgkinson, who later died from his wounds. Police have not commented on his motivation.

Scalise was the first sitting member of Congress to have been shot since Arizona Representative Gabrielle Giffords was attacked in the 2011 Tucson shooting.

President Donald Trump issued a statement saying, "We are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with the members of Congress, their staffs, Capitol Police, first responders, and all others affected." Vice President Pence made similar comments.
