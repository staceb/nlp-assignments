Thaler

The Thaler (or Taler or Talir) was a silver coin that was used throughout Europe for almost four hundred years. It was named after the "Joachimsthaler", a type of coin from the city of Joachimsthal (Jáchymov) in Bohemia. It is where the names "dollar" and "tolar" come from. The Thaler was first made in 1518.
