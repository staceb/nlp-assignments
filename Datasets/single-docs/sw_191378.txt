Thelyphonida

Thelyphonida is an order of arachnids commonly known as vinegarroons.

They give out a vinegar-like mist (containing mostly acetic acid). The Vinegarroon is not venomous and is not a true scorpion. It is related to spiders, true scorpions, and ticks. They are also known as whip scorpions because they look like true scorpions and because of their whip like tails.
