Clodomir Santos de Morais

Clodomir Santos de Morais, PhD (30 September 1928 – 25 March 2016), was a Brazilian sociologist. He worked with the Organization Workshop (OW) and the associated Activity-based Large Group Capacitation Method (LGCM).

In the 1940s and 1950s de Morais worked as a trade unionist and a journalist. He became a member of the Pernambuco State Assembly and co-founder of the Ligas Camponêsas (Peasant Leagues). After the 1964 coup he was forced into exile, first in Chile, and, as ILO Regional Advisor on Agrarian Reform for Central America, he later worked as Agrarian Reform consultant in Latin America, Portugal and Africa.

After the end of military rule de Morais returned to Brazil in 1988, answering a call from the University of Brasilia to help in the 'hidden civil war' of unemployment.
