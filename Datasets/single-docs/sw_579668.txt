Brian Matthew

Brian Matthew (17 September 1928 – 8 April 2017) was an English broadcaster. He worked for the BBC from 1954 until his retirement 2017. He began presenting "Sounds of the 60s" in 1990, often employing the same vocabulary and the same measured delivery he had used in previous years. 

On 27 January 2017, the BBC announced that he would not return to the programme because of ill health.

At the time of his retirement, Matthew was the oldest active DJ in Britain.

Matthew was born on 17 September 1928 in Coventry, Warwickshire. He studied at Bablake School. In 1951, he married Pamela Wickington. They had one son: Christopher.

In January 2017, Matthew collapsed at his home and was hospitalized in critical condition. Matthew was reported to have died on 4 April 2017, but a BBC statement later explained this was a mistake, but remains "critically ill". Matthew later died on 8 April 2017 at the age of 88.
