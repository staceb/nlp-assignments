Colada morada

Colada morada (Spanish for "dark purple strained") is a traditional Ecuadorian drink. It is prepared with black corn flour and fruits such as naranjilla, babaco, pineapple, blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries (which give it its color). The drink is sweetened with cane sugar. It is served hot.
