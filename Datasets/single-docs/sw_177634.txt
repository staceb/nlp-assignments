Canadian Security Intelligence Service

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) (French: Service Canadien du renseignement de sécurité) (SCRS) is the main intelligence agency of the Canadian government. It is responsible for collecting, analyzing and reporting intelligence on threats to Canada's national security, and conducting operations, covert and overt, within Canada and abroad.

Its headquarters are located at 1941 Ogilvie Road, in Ottawa, Ontario, in a purpose-built facility completed in 1995. CSIS (pronounced /ˈsiːsɪs/) is responsible to Parliament through the Minister of Public Safety, but is also overseen by the Federal Court system, the Inspector General of Canada, and the Security Intelligence Review Committee.

CSIS is a spy agency, similar to the CIA in the United States.
