1978 January subtropical storm

Subtropical Storm One gave the 1978 Huricane season a very early start when it became the only Atlantic cyclone to form in the month of January, after it had formed on January 18. It dissipated on the 23rd causing no damage to land and only threatening land briefly. There were two storm in the month of January but they formed in December, they were: Hurricane Alice in 1954 and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005. Since 1978 there has never another Tropical or Subtropical cyclone to form in the month of January. 

Because there was no naming system for Subtropical Storms at the time, this was called Subtropical Storm One, had it been given a name it would be "Subtropical Storm Amelia".
