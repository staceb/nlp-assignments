Bimini

Bimini is the westernmost district of the Bahamas. Bimini is the closest point in the Bahamas to the mainland United States. It is about 137 miles (209 km) west-northwest of Nassau. There are about 1600 people on the chain of islands. The capital is Alice Town. South Bimini Airport is on South Bimini island. The ocean around the islands is said to be one of the world's top big-game fishing spots. 

Bimini is home to several unique and threatened species. The Bimini Boa is the largest of the reptiles on Bimini. The Bimini Ameiva is a very common, fast moving lizard on the island. The Smalltooth sawfish is one of the rarest fish in the world.
