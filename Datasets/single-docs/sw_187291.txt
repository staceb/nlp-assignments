Ekaltadeta

The Ekaltadeta was a giant, meat-eating rat-kangaroo from Australia. This long-extinct marsupial (pouched mammal) lived from the late Oligocene (roughly 25 million years ago) until about 50 thousands years ago. Fossils have been found in northern Australia, at the Riversleigh site (in Queensland).
