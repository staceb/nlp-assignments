Gramophone (magazine)

Gramophone is a magazine published monthly in London by Haymarket for classical music, particularly recordings. It was started in 1923 by the Scottish author Compton Mackenzie. The magazine presents the Gramophone Awards each year to the classical recordings which it considers the best in a variety of categories. 

In the title bar of its website, "Gramophone" says they are "The world's authority on classical music since 1923." This used to appear on the front cover of every issue, although recent editions have changed the wording to "The world's best classical music reviews."
