Hibernate (OS feature)

Hibernation is a technology used in certain operating systems. It allows to save the contents of the system memory onto a hard disk or other permanent storage. The computer can then be powered off. When it is powered up again, this information can be read again. That way the system will start up much faster.

The amount of free space on the hard disk needs to be greater than the amount of RAM in order for hibernation to work.
