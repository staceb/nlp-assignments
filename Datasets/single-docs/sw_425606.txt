Fall Again

"Fall Again" is a song written and composed by Walter Afanasieff and Robin Thicke in 1999. They made it for Michael Jackson to perform. Jackson recorded a demo (draft) of the song in 1999 for his album "Invincible". He never finished it, however, and the song was never added to the album. It has since been performed by many other artists.
