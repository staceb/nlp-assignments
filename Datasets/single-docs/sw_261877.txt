2006 Copiapó mining accident

On January 20, 2006, an explosion occurred in the underground copper mine of Carola-Agustina in Copiapó, Chile, shortly after two trucks collided, covering the only escape route for the miners inside the mine.

The explosion caused two deaths, two injured and 70 miners stayed trapped for 7 hours.

At the nearby mine, "Punta de Cobre", miners constructed a tunnel to allow evacuations in case of emergencies, after the explosion.
