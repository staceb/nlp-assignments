Exit (system call)

exit in computing means to terminate a task or program. On many computer operating systems, a process is stopped by making a system call, called exit. An exit in a multithreading environment means that a thread of execution has stopped running. The operating system reclaims memory that was used by the process. The process is said to be a "dead process" after it terminates.
