Thai food

Thai food is a type of food that was first made in Thailand. Thai food is often spicy, but does not have to be. Thai food is shared with every person at the table. The meal is not thrown away. The Thai believe that throwing food away would anger the "god of rice". Thai food is eaten with a fork and a large spoon.
