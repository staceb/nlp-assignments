Wyandot people

The Wyandot people (also called Wendats or Huron) are a tribe of Native Americans. Samuel de Champlain traded fur with them. In the 17th and 18th centuries they were allies of New France, and enemies of the Iroquois and New Netherland and New York. 

The Wyandots signed the Treaty of Detroit on November 17 in the year 1807. They signed it with other Native Americans from three other tribes called the Odawa, Ojibwe and Potawatomi. The tribes gave up areas of Michigan and Ohio to the United States to own.
