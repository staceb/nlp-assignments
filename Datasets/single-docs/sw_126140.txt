Chariot

"This article is about the mode of transport, for the album see Chariot (album)"

A chariot is a type of transport used by many ancient civilisations and people. A chariot is horse-drawn, meaning that is pulled along by horses. A person who rides a chariot is called a charioteer. 

Ancient Greek myths says that Poseidon, god of the sea, and Athena, goddess of wisdom, created the chariot together. Poseidon created the horses like waves, and Athena made the chariot. The two gods worked together.
