Saw 3D

Saw 3D is a 2010 American horror movie, the seventh and final motion picture of the "Saw" franchise. This installment of the series is about a man who claims to be a Jigsaw survivor and writes a book of his experience. An 8th movie was planned, though a decrease in performance at the box office for Saw VI led to Saw 3D being the last planned movie in the series. "Saw 3D" was released October 29, 2010 in the United States. The movie was originally rated NC-17 (No Children 17 or Under Admitted) and had to be edited six times to receive an R rating. The movie's reviews were not positive, although "Saw 3D" did make $136 million at the box office.
