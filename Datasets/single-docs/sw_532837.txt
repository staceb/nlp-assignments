Briggs Initiative

California Proposition 6, also known as Briggs Initiative, was an initiative on the California state ballot on November 7, 1978. It did not pass. It was sponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state legislator from Orange County. The initiative would have banned homosexuals from working in California public schools.

The San Francisco politician Harvey Milk fought the measure. California Governor Ronald Reagan and President Jimmy Carter were against it. Polls had originally showed support for the initiative leading by a large margin. It was defeated by the LGBT community, conservatives and liberals alike.
