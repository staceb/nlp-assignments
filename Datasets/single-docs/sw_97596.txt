Folk rock

Folk rock music is a mixture of folk music with modern rock music. Folk rock began in the mid 1960s with performers like the Byrds. Folk singer Bob Dylan created a sensation at the 1965 Newport Festival when he used electric guitar in his performance. This led to many groups wanting to play folk music in the rock style. These groups included Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span, Pentangle and Alan Stivell.
