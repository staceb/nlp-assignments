Under twelve-tone equal temperament, "B sharp", for instance, is enharmonically equivalent to (sounds the same as), "C natural", and "G sharp" is enharmonically equivalent to "A flat".

Double sharps also exist; these have the symbol and raise a note by two semitones, or a whole step. Less often there are half or three-quarter sharps.
