Sulphur-crested cockatoo

Sulphur-crested cockatoos are large white parrots with yellow heads and tails. There are four subspecies of the bird. They live in Australian forests. Farmers do not like sulphur-crested cockatoos because the cockatoos eat vegetables that the farmers have grown. They are a protected species, but sometimes get shot.

Many people like sulphur-crested cockatoos and keep them as pets. They are very loud and have a natural desire to chew wood and other materials. They are very long-lived. In captivity they can live to 70 years. One cockatoo called Fred was still alive at 100 years of age in 2014.
