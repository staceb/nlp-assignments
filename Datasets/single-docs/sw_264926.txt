Bignoniaceae

Bignoniaceae or the Trumpet creeper or catalpa family of the mint order of flowering plants. It contains about 112 genera and more than 725 species of trees, shrubs, and, most commonly, vines, chiefly of tropical America, tropical Africa, and the Indo-Malayan region. They form an important part of the tropical forest vegetation because of the numerous climbing vines. A few are found in temperate regions, notably the catalpa tree ("Catalpa"), the trumpet creeper ("Campsis"), and the cross vine ("Bignonia").
