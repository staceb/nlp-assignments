Rove beetle

The rove beetles are a family of beetles. The scientific name is Staphylinidae. It is the largest family of beetles. It has over 63,000 species. Some of these species are very old; fossils of rove beetles have been dated to the Triassic, 200 million years ago.

They are mainly recognised by their short elytra (wing covers) that usually cover only half of their abdomens.
