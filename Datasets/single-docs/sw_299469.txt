Auðr

Auðr (Old Norse "prosperity") or Aud is in the Norse mythology a son of Naglfari and Nótt, and half-brother of Jörð (Earth) and Dagr (Day). He is an uncle of Thor. Jörð is called "Auðr's splendid sister".

Scholar Rudolf Simek theorizes that Auðr is the invention of Snorri Sturluson. Simek notes that Auðr is a female name in other Icelandic sources.
