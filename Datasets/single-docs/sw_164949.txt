Cordes-sur-Ciel

Cordes-sur-Ciel () is a commune of the Tarn "département", in France.

The fortified town (bastide) was built in 1222 by the Count of Toulouse. It is now a popular tourist spot. Until recently the town's name was Cordes, a word thought to come from the Indo-European root "corte" meaning "rocky heights."
