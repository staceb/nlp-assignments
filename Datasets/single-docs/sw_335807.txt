Dominance (ethology)

In the context of the behaviour of animals, dominance means that one animal, or a small group has a high social status. Because of this status, these animals get better access to resources, such as food. Dominance (and submission, the contrary) is always linked to the relationship of two animals, one of them has a higher social status than the other.
