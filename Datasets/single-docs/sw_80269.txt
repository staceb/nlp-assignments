Department store

A department store is a store that sells many different products. It does not sell the products of only one company, as some other stores do. In a department store a person can usually buy clothing, furniture, electronics, and sometimes paint, hardware, toiletries, cosmetics, photographic equipment, jewellery, toys, and sporting goods. Depertment stores are often upmarket places. 

Some department stores sell products cheaper than other stores. They are then called discount department stores.
