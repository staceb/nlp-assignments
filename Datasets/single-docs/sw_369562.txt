Open Database License

The Open Database License (ODbL) is a copyright license for sharing database contents. The ODbL is "copyleft" because it makes the copyrighted work easier to share.

The license is provided by the Open Knowledge Foundation.

In September 2012 the OpenStreetMap (OSM) project moved from a Creative Commons license to ODbL.
