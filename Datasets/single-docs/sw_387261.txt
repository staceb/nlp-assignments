Burning Bush (Christian symbol)

The Burning Bush is an object described in the Book of Exodus. It was said to be on Mount Horeb. According to the narrative, the bush was on fire, but was not consumed (all burned up) by the flames. This is the reason for the name given to the bush. In the narrative, the "burning bush" is where Moses was chosen by God to lead the Israelites out of Egypt and into Canaan.
