Grady Sizemore

Grady Sizemore III (born August 2, 1982) is a retired American baseball player. He played for four Major League Baseball teams: the Cleveland Indians, Boston Red Sox, Philadelphia Phillies, and Tampa Bay Rays. He was a center fielder.

Sizemore graduated from Cascade High School in Everett, Washington in 2000. A notable high school star in football, basketball, and baseball, Sizemore signed a letter of intent to play football and baseball at the University of Washington. At the time of his high school graduation, Sizemore was the Cascade all-time leader in rushing yards with 3,081 yards and interceptions with 16.

Sizemore did not play for the college because the Expos selected Sizemore in the 3rd round of the 2000 Draft. The team offered him a $2 million signing bonus for him not to play for the college. Sizemore signed and almost immediately began his quick climb to the big leagues. 

In 2002, he was traded to the Cleveland Indians by the Montreal Expos.

In 2006, Sizemore was selected to his first All-Star Game as a reserve outfielder.

Sizemore currently resides in Mill Creek, Washington and Tempe, Arizona.
