Holler If Ya Hear Me

"Holler If Ya Hear Me" is the first single off American rapper 2Pac's second studio album "Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.". The song samples the songs "Do It Any Way You Wanna" by People's Choice and "Rebel Without a Pause" by Public Enemy.

The song is about frustrations with black poverty, police injustice, and Shakur's perceived harassment from political figure Dan Quayle.

The editor of "Vibe" was quoted in TIME as stating that the song struck a chord with a large section of disaffected youth.
