Already Gone

"Already Gone" is a song by the recording artist Kelly Clarkson from her 2009 record "All I Ever Wanted". This was the third single from that album to be released. The song is about the breakup of a relationship. Its release was surrounded by controversy: Clarkson said the arrangement used for the song was strongly similar to the 2008 song "Halo" from singer Beyoncé and feared the public would say Clarkson had stolen it. Despite this, however, the song received strong praise from critics, and "Already Gone" became one of the highlights from "All I Ever Wanted". On the "Billboard" Hot 100 the single peaked at #13.
