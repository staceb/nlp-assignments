In 2008, Peter Venkman was selected by the magazine "Empire" as one of "The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time", described by Empire's Nick de Semlyen as "the ultimate New York hero: cynical, sarcastic, secretly sweet-natured", "a man possessed by manic spontaneity, with a wont to twirl in circles around a public concourse or declare undying love for a woman he's just met", and the "most popular" character played by Murray.
