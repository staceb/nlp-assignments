Cristobal Tapia de Veer

Juan Cristobal Tapia de Veer also known as "Cristo", is a film and television score composer, arranger, producer and multi-instrumentalist based in Montreal, QC, Canada. He is mostly known for his music to the British 6-part drama UTOPIA for which he won an RTS Craft Award in the best original score category in 2013.

Cristo was born during the military coup d'état in Chile. First, his parents fled to Paris, France. While his father decided to stay there, his mother took him back to Chile. Life under Pinochet's dictatorship still proved impossible, so they found political refuge in Québec, Canada.

He obtained a master's degree in Classical Music (specialization in percussion) from the Conservatoire de musique du Québec. In 2001 he got signed to Warner Music with his pop-band "One Ton", putting a hold on his classical career. The trio won the Canadian Dance Music Award (SOCAN) in 2003 with the electro-dance single "Supersex World". It was Cristo who produced the album.

In 2011, his music for the Victorian 4-part drama "The Crimson Petal and the White" (dir: Marc Munden, BBC2) totally surprised the audiences.

Matthew Gilbert, The Boston Globe, U.S.:

"The soundtrack ranges from gnawing electronic hums to choral ecstasy. It's all brilliantly, effectively, appropriately jarring, even if it sends the Masterpiece crowd to the medicine cabinet for Dramamine."

His latest work is in the conspiracy thriller "UTOPIA" created by Dennis Kelly, that aired on Channel 4. A second series has already been commissioned.

The Royal Television Society awarded him a Craft & Design Awards for "best original music" in November 2013.

He wrote music for a new TV-show called "Série Noire", written and directed by the writers of "Les Invincibles", released in January 2014 on Radio-Canada.
