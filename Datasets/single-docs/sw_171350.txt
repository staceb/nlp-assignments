Sandringham House

Sandringham House is in Norfolk, England. It has been in the British royal family since Albert, Prince Consort bought it for Edward VII of the United Kingdom. 

Like Balmoral, it is the private property of the monarch of the United Kingdom, not an official, government owned, building. This meant that when Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 the new king, George VI, had to buy the properties from his brother.

York Cottage is in the grounds of Sandringham Estate.
