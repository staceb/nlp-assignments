Newark Liberty International Airport

Newark Liberty International Airport , first named Newark Metropolitan Airport and later Newark International Airport, is an airport located in New Jersey. It is located between Newark and Elizabeth. It is around 15 miles (24 km) southwest of Midtown Manhattan in New York City. It is owned by the city of Newark and run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It was the first major airport in the United States. It is the busiest airport in the New York metropolitan area by number of flights.

The New York City metropolitan area's John F. Kennedy International Airport, LaGuardia Airport, and Newark Liberty International airports are the largest airport system in the United States. They are the second busiest system of airports in the world by number of passengers. They are the busiest in the world in terms of total flight operations. In 2012, the airport had just under 34 million million passengers. JFK had 49.3 million, and LaGuardia had 25.7 million.

On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 left Newark on its way to San Francisco International Airport. Two hours later, it crashed into a field just outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all crew members and passengers on the plane. The passengers had tried to take over the plane from a team of terrorists who took over it. Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania, it is believed that the plane would have crashed into the United States Capitol or the White House. In 2002, to honor the people who were killed on September 11, the airport's name was changed from "Newark International Airport" to "Newark Liberty International Airport".
