Asiatic salamander

The Asiatic salamanders (family Hynobiidae) are a primitive kind of salamander which can be found throughout Asia. Unlike other salamanders, Hynobiid salamanders do external fertilization, or "spawning". The females lay egg-sacs, and the males pour sperm onto the sacs.

They and the giant salamanders (family Cryptobranchidae), make up the suborder Cryptobranchoidea. About half of hynobiids are unique to Japan.
