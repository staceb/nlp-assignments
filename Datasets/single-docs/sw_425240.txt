Water politics

Water politics are the politics related to whether people have enough fresh drinking water (see water scarcity). There is less fresh water available for many reasons. One reason is that some industries use huge amounts of water. Another problem is water pollution, which occurs when dangerous chemicals or human waste gets into the water. Currently, 40% of the people in the world do not have enough fresh water. More than 2.2 million people died in 2000 from diseases that were caused by drinking polluted, dirty water or drought.
