Serano is a feminist. She is bisexual.

For years she was a crossdresser. She wore clothes made for women but still called herself a man. In 1998 Serano moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. There she met her wife Dani. Around this time Serano started identifying as bigender and transgender. In 2001 she started identifying as a trans woman. She calls herself a "femme tomboy".

In 2002 made a chapbook called "Either/Or". In 2004 she made a chapbook called "Draw Blood".
In 2005 Serano made a chapbook called "On the Outside Looking In: A Trans Woman's Perspective on Feminism and the Exclusion of Trans Women from Lesbian and Women-only Spaces".

Serano's first book "Whipping Girl" talks about transmisogyny. Transmisogyny is a word that Serano uses to talk about a kind of misogyny (woman-hating) that is experienced by trans women. "Whipping Girl" has updated versions of three of the four essays in "On the Outside Looking In".

In her second book "Excluded", Serano wrote about how feminist and queer movements have left out transgender women, feminine people, bisexuals, sex workers, and others.

In both of her books Serano talks about how gender is not a performance.
