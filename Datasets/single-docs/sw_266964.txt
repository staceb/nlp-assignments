Charter 08

Charter 08 is a manifesto (a public declaration of your beliefs) initially signed by over 350 Chinese intellectuals and human rights activists to promote political reform and democratization in the People's Republic of China. It was published on 10 December 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, using a similar name and style from the anti-Soviet Charter 77 issued by dissidents in Czechoslovakia. Since its release, more than 8,100 people inside and outside of China have signed the charter.

One of the authors of Charter '08, Liu Xiaobo, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010. He died of liver cancer in July 2017 while under medical leave during his prison sentence.
