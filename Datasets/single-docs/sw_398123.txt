Diana's Peak

Diana's Peak is the highest point on the island of Saint Helena. It is high. It is of volcanic origin.

It was made a national park in March 1996, the first on the island. It is covered by many tree ferns.

The peak is at the point where three districts meet: Sandy Bay (southwest), Levelwood (east) and Longwood (north). The nearest settlements are Bamboo Hedge (the main settlement of Sandy Bay District), Hutt's Gate (in Longwood District) and Levelwood Village. Diana's Peak is part of the Peaks Ridge, a narrow and short mountain range in the centre of the island. Other peaks there are Mt. Actaeon and Cuckold's Point.
