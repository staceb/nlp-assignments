Hurricane Iris

Hurricane Iris was the third major hurricane of the 2001 Atlantic hurricane season. Hurricane Iris was also the second storm of 2001 to strike Belize. Iris was a category 4 hurricane when it struck Belize, but damage was rather low. It is likely because Iris weakened very quickly over land. People were thinking that Iris would cross Central America without dying and would keep the name Iris. This did not happen, Iris weakened over land very fast and died. Iris did however reformed in the Pacific Ocean, it was given a new name, Manuel. Iris left $150 million in damage and killed 49 people. 

The name Iris was retired anyway. In 2007 the name Ingrid was used instead.
