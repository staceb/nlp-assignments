Shah Alam II

Shah Alam II, (25 June 1728 – 19 November 1806) was the eighteenth Mughal Emperor and the son of Alamgir II. He became the emperor of the Mughal Empire; his power was so depleted during his reign that it led to a saying in the Persian language, "Sultanat-e-Shah Alam, Az Dilli ta Palam", meaning, 'The kingdom of Shah Alam is from Delhi to Palam', Palam being a suburb of Delhi.
