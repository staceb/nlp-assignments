Regent's University London

Regent's University London is a private, not-for-profit university in London. It is one of six private teaching institutions in the UK which can award degrees. 

It offers dual American and British programmes. It is the second oldest but largest private university in the country. The university has 15% of applicants from the UK, 10% from the United States and the rest from all over the world. Fees are about £14,000 a year for undergraduate courses. 

Regent's University London has its campus in Regent's Park, central London. It was built on the site of South Villa, one of the original eight Regent's Park villas. Regent's occupies buildings left by the former Bedford College of the University of London. Bedford College merged with Royal Holloway College, and moved out of London into Surrey.

Regent's has a second campus in Marylebone, called Regent's Marylebone. There it runs the Regents School of Fashion and Design, a range of qualifications in fashion design, marketing, interior design and visual communication.
