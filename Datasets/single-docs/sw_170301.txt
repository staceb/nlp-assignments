Art exhibition

An art exhibition is a place where works of art are shown to the public. The word exhibition comes from Latin "exhibere", which means "to show". This can be in a museum or an exhibition hall. The exhibition can be temporary, or permanent (like a section of a museum). Some exhibitions show works of art of the same artist, others show works of art on a common theme.
