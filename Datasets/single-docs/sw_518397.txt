Fashion week

A fashion week is a fashion industry event lasting about one week. This is where fashion designers, brands or "houses" show their latest clothing in runway shows to buyers and the media. These events let the rest of the industry know what's "in" and what's "out" for the season.

The most prominent fashion weeks are held in the four fashion capitals of the world. These are the New York, London, Milan and Paris. 

Other notable fashion events are held in cities around the world. These include Berlin (Berlin Fashion Week) and São Paulo (São Paulo Fashion Week), among many others.
