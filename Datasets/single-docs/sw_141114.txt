Beatitudes

The Beatitudes (from Latin "beatus", meaning "blessed" or "happy") are a list of traits that Christians should follow told by Gospel of Matthew and Gospel of Luke. Some of these include humbleness, meekness, and making peace. 

Jesus Christ taught these ideas as part of a three lesson sermon; the Sermon on the Mount.
