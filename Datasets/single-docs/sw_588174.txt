Sotirios "Sam" Panopoulos (; 1934 – 8 June 2017) was a Greek-born Canadian cook and businessman. He was born in Vourvoura, Greece. He was known as the inventor of Hawaiian pizza.

With his brothers Elias and Nikitas, Panopoulos owned the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. They offered typical American items such as burgers and fries, and also American Chinese dishes, some of which also mix sweet and savory flavours. In the early 1960s Panopoulos started offering pizzas, recently popular in the USA. In 1962 he had the idea to add canned pineapple to pizza.

Panopoulos died of cardiac arrest at a hospital in London, Ontario on 8 June 2017, aged 83.
