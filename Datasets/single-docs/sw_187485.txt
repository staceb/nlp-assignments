Internet fraud

Internet fraud means trying to trick or scam someone else using the Internet. This usually means that the person who is being tricked loses money to the people scamming them. Internet fraud can take place on computer programs such as chat rooms, e-mail, message boards, or Web sites. Advertisements that pop up on the internet have a big risk of being scams.
