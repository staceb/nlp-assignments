Communes of the Pyrénées-Orientales department

The "département" of the Pyrénées-Orientales is composed of 226 communes.

Most of the territory (except for the district of Fenolheda) formed part of the Principality of Catalonia until 1659, and Catalan is still spoken (in addition to French) by a significant minority of the population. The Catalan names of communes are taken from the "Enciclopèdia catalana" and are intended for comparison with the official French names: they do not indicate the current or former linguistic status of the commune.

The following names of communes are no longer in use, 
either because the commune has been absorbed into another 
commune or because it has changed name.
