Bull Terrier

The Bull Terrier is a breed of dog that originated in 19th-century England from a mixture of other dogs. They were first used as fighting dogs. 

Bull terriers have a short coat, small triangular eyes and an egg shaped head. They are about 21–22 inches (53–56 cm) in height and weigh about 50–60 pounds (23–27 kg). Bull terriers are very strong for their size.
