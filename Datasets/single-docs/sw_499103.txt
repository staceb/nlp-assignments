Lance-Corporal Jones

Lance Corporal Jack Jones is a fictional Home Guard platoon lance-corporal, veteran of the British Empire and butcher. 

He was played by Clive Dunn in the BBC television sitcom "Dad's Army" and by Tom Courtenay in the upcoming 2015 movie "Dad's Army". His catchphrases are "Don't panic!", "Permission to speak, sir?" and "They don't like it up 'em!", and sometimes "You saved my life!" (usually to Captain Mainwaring).
