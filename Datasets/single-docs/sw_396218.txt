Queen Liliʻuokalani

Queen Liliʻuokalani (1838-1917) was the last monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii. She was well educated and traveled widely. She married John Owen Dominis on September 16, 1862. He became the Governor of Oahu and Maui. The couple had no children. She was an accomplished musician. "Aloha ʻOe" is her best known composition. 

In 1891, Liliʻuokalani became Queen of Hawaii when her brother, the king, died. In 1893, she wanted a new constitution. This caused the American minister in Hawaii great concern. American soldiers took over the ʻIolani Palace and other government buildings. In 1894, they removed Queen Liliʻuokalani as queen. The United States set up a provisional government. It became the Republic of Hawaii. 

The Hawaiian people were on the side of their Queen. President Grover Cleveland offered to return the throne if she granted amnesty to all involved in the takeover of her kingdom. She refused, but then changed her mind and agreed. She was denied her reinstatement by the Provisional Government. On July 4, 1894, the Republic of Hawaii began. Liliʻuokalani died on November 11, 1917 following a stroke.
