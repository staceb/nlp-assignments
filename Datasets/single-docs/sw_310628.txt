Institution of Electrical Engineers

The Institution of Electrical Engineers (I.E.E., pronounced "I-double-E" or "I-E-E") was a British professional organisation of electronics, electrical, manufacturing, and Information Technology professionals. It focused on electrical engineers. The I.E.E. was founded in 1871 as the Society of Telegraph Engineers. It changed its name in 1880 to the Society of Telegraph Engineers and Electricians. The name changed again to the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1889. It was Incorporated by a Royal Charter in 1921. In 2006, the I.E.E. merged with the Institution of Incorporated Engineers (I.I.E.) to form the Institution of Engineering and Technology (I.E.T.). Before the merger, the I.E.E. was the largest professional engineering society in Europe, with a worldwide membership of around 120,000.
