Big hair

Big hair is a term used to describe hair that has a lot of volume and sticks up around the head. The style was very popular in the 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. Many subcultures were known for having this hairstyle. These included punk, glam, goth and alternative. Today, it is occasionally used with Japanese teenagers.
