Pauline Kael

Pauline Kael (; June 19, 1919 – September 3, 2001) was an American movie critic who wrote for "The New Yorker" magazine from 1968 to 1991. Earlier in her career, her work appeared in "City Lights", "McCall's" and "The New Republic". 

Kael was known for her "witty, biting, highly opinionated, and sharply focused" reviews. Legendary critic Roger Ebert said that Kael "had a more positive influence on the climate for film in America than any other single person over the last three decades".

Kael was born in Petaluma, California. She studied at the University of California, Berkeley. Kael died in Great Barrington, Massachusetts from Parkinson's disease at the age of 82.
