Albumin

Albumin is the name for a number of globular proteins that can be dissolved in water. Albumin is found in blood serum. Albumin is also found in egg white. The albumin index is used to measure the freshness of an egg. It measures how far an egg spreads if broken on a flat smooth surface. The older an egg is, the further it spreads.
