Web resource

A web resource is anything that can be obtained from the World Wide Web. Some examples are web pages, e-mail, information from databases, and web services. Web resources have changed since the Internet was first created. The early concept was of static (non moving) files or documents. The meaning of the term now has a wider use to include nearly everything that can be obtained via the Internet. Uniform resource locators or URLs, are used to identify a resource on the web.
