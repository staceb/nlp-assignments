Wood ash

Wood ash is the powder left after wood has been in a fire, such as a home fireplace or an industrial power plant. Some gardeners use it to make potash. After being burned, only a small amount of wood is left as wood ash.

Wood ash has also been used in ceramic glazes, in China, Japan, and Korea. It has also been used to make soap.
