Lambert Lombard

Lambert Lombard (Liège, 1505 – 1566) was a Renaissance painter, architect and theorist for the Prince-Bishopric of Liège. During his career he worked for Jan Gossaert in Middelburg and trained Frans Floris. In 1532 he became court painter and architect in Liège. A few paintings and many drawings have been kept.

In 1537 he was sent to Rome by Erard de la Marck, prince-bishop of Liège, to buy works of art. While there he discovered the wonders of the Italian Renaissance. On his return he brought not only works of art, but also the new ideas about art to Liège. 

Dominicus Lampsonius wrote a biography of Lombard called "The Life of Lambert Lombard".
