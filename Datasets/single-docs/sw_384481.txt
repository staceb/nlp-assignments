Faxing Berlin

Faxing Berlin is a progressive house song by Canadian electronic music producer deadmau5. The song is featured on deadmau5's third studio album "Random Album Title". 

The song received some controversy in 2008 by an artist named DirtyCircuit. DirtyCircuit said that he was threatened with legal action after he used a sample called "LP_Faxing Berlin C_128bpm" that came bundled with the digital audio workstation FL Studio which deadmau5 claimed copyright. The sample was a direct clip of a full bar from the song. A "Demo Track" was provided by deadmau5 which came bundled with FL Studio, along with many loop samples. FL Studio users became were in discomfort because of the case and some of the users had pointed out possible inconsistencies in the EULA of the software.

The song reached #6 on the Billboard US Hot Dance Club Songs.
