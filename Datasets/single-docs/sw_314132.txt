Girl You Know It's True

"Girl You Know It's True" is a 1988 song by Milli Vanilli. The song hit #3 in the United Kingdom and #2 in the United States. In 1989, while the duo performed the song during a concert in Connecticut, the record skipped and revealed a case of lip synching. This created controversy and eventually led to the end of Milli Vanilli.
