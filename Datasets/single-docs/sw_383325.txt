When Kirby wakes up, he notices a star in the sky. The star tells him to follow it so they can defeat Necrodeus. With that, Kirby begins his adventure to defeat Necrodeus and bring himself back together.

In "Kirby Mass Attack", the player takes control of up to 10 Kirbys. The player uses these Kirbys to defeat enemies and solve puzzles. This is done with the console's touch screen. The player taps obstacles or enemies to send multiple Kirbys towards them. The player can swipe the touch screen to use the Kirbys as projectile weapons. To get Kirbys, the player has to collect fruit seen in levels. Each level requires a certain number of Kirbys to enter. In some levels, there are puzzles where you need all 10 Kirbys to solve them.
