Federal Capital Territory

The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) around Karachi was the original Capital territory of Pakistan. The FCT was created in 1948 from the city of Karachi and surrounding areas as the location for Pakistan's capital following independence. The FCT was bordered by the province of Sind Province (1936–1955) to the northeast and the princely state of State of Las Bela to the northwest with the Arabian Sea to the south.
