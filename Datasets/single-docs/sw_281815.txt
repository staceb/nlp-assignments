Hydroplaning (tires)

Hydroplaning or Aquaplaning happens when a layer of water builds between the rubber tires of the vehicle and the road surface and leads to the loss of traction (grip) on the road. Hydroplaning causes the vehicle to stop responding to control inputs such as steering, braking or accelerating. The effects of hydroplaning depends on which wheels have lost traction and the direction that the vehicle is traveling.
