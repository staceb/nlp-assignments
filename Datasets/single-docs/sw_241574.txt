They soon became famous, performing in the Carnegie Hall in 2000 and at the Edinburgh International Festival in 2001. They played regularly in the Wigmore Hall in London from 2001 to 2006 (they were called "quartet in residence"). The quartet has also performed at the Vienna Musikverein and the Amsterdam Concertgebouw. They have made many recordings. 

The players names are: Corina Belcea-Fisher and Laura Samuel (violins), Krzysztof Chorzelski (viola) and Antoine Lederlin, (cello). Originally the cellist was Alasdair Tait.
