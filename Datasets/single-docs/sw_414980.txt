Game pie

Game pie is a kind of meat pie made with game. It has been made since Roman times. 

Its main ingredients, then and now, are wild birds and animals such as partridge, pheasant, deer and hare. The pies became very elaborate during the 18th century in England. They developed complex recipes and special moulds and serving dishes. The versions cooked today are more simple, but they still include rabbit, venison, pigeon, pheasant, and other game meats.

The "Oreiller de la Belle Aurore" is an elaborate game pie named after Claudine-Aurore Récamier, the mother of Brillat-Savarin. The large square pie, which was one of her son's favorite meals, contains a variety of game birds and their livers, veal, pork, truffles, aspic, and more, in puff pastry. It is described in the classic encyclopedia of gastronomy, the Larousse Gastronomique. It is one of three pies named after people from Brillat-Savarin's home town of Belley (later called Bugey). They were described by Lucien Tenret.
