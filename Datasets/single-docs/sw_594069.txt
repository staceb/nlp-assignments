University of Saskatchewan

The University of Saskatchewan (U of S) is a Canadian public research university, first started in 1907 and found on the east side of the South Saskatchewan River in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The University of Saskatchewan is the biggest educator in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The University of Saskatchewan is one of Canada’s top research universities (based on the number of Canada Research Chairs) and is a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities (the 15 universities in Canada where the most research is done.) 

The university began as an agricultural (farming) college in 1907 and set-up the first Canadian university-based department of extension (teaching people who have already finished school new things, without having to be a full-time student) in 1910. There were set aside for university buildings and for the U of S farm, and farming fields. In total was set aside for the university. The main University campus is situated upon , with another allocated for Innovation Place Research Park. The University of Saskatchewan agriculture college still has access to city land nearby. The University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization (VIDO) facility, (2003) develops DNA-enhanced immunization vaccines for both humans and animals.
Ever since it started out as an agricultural college, research has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the cobalt-60 cancer treatment unit. The university teaches more than 200 academic programs. 

A location next to the South Saskatchewan River, across from the city centre of Saskatoon, was picked for the campus. David Robertson Brown of Brown & Vallance were the first architects making a campus plan and the first university buildings in Collegiate Gothic style: The Prime Minister of Canada, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, laid the first stone of the first building, the College Building, on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the College Building, built 1910–1912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada.

Brown & Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910–12); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910–12). Brown & Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910–12) as well as additions 1913 in 1920 and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown & Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910–12) and Emmanuel College (1910–12). Brown & Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911–12) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown & Vallance constructed the President's Residence (1911–13) Qu'Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914–16) Physics Building (1919–21); Chemistry Building (1922–23); St. Andrew's Presbyterian College (1922–23); Memorial Gates (1927–28) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929).

The original buildings were built using local limestone – greystone – which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, this greystone became one of the most recognizable things about the campus. When the local supply of limestone ran out, the University turned to Tyndall stone, which is found in Manitoba. Saskatchewan's Provincial University and Agricultural College were officially opened May 1, 1913 by Hon. Walter Scott.
