Cohesion (chemistry)

Cohesion or cohesive attraction or cohesive force is a physical property of an object. It happens because of intermolecular attraction between like-molecules.

Cohesion holds hydrogen bonds together to create surface tension on water. Since water is attracted to other molecules, adhesive forces pull the water toward other molecules.
