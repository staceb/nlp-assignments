Dr. Luigi

Dr. Luigi is an upcoming puzzle video game for the Wii U console. It was developed by Nintendo and Arika. It was released in North America on December 31, 2013, and will be released in Europe on January 15, 2014.

The gameplay of "Dr. Luigi" is to make sure vitamins of the same color are lined up together. There are three colors of vitamins: red, blue, and yellow. The player has to clear the field of viruses by dropping capsules with two colors on them. The player moves the capsules as they fall by moving them left or right and rotating them. The player gets points by killing viruses. The game ends if the bottle fills up with capsules.

There are four different modes. "Retro Remedy" is played like other "Dr. Mario" games. In "Operation L", capsules that are shaped like an L are dropped into the playing field. In "Virus Buster", players hold the Wii U GamePad vertically, and use the controller's touch screen to drop the capsules onto the playing field. In "Online Battle", players can play against other people through online multiplayer.
