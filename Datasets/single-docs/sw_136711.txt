Sadomasochism

Sadomasochism is a word which is mostly used in a social (non-medical) way. It means that people get together to either give or receive pain and humiliation. Usually it's a form of sex play. 

"Sadists" enjoy inflicting pain on others or humiliating them. "Masochists" get pleasure from being tortured, hurt, or humiliated.
