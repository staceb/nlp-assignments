Garden cress

Garden cress is a fast-growing eatable herb that is related to watercress and mustard, sharing their peppery taste and aroma. Garden cress is usually grown in England, France, the Netherlands and Scandinavia.

Garden Cress is added to soups, sandwiches and salads for its tangy taste. It is also eaten as sprouts, and the fresh or dried seed pods can be used as a peppery seasoning. In England, cut cress shoots are used in sandwiches with boiled eggs, mayonnaise and salt.
