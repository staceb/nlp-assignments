I Remember

I Remember is a song by Canadian electronic music producer deadmau5 and American DJ Kaskade. The song is featured on deadmau5's first studio album "Random Album Title" and the Strobelite Edit is featured on Kaskade's fifth solo album "Strobelite Seduction".

The song is featured on the soundtrack of the 2011 film The Lincoln Lawyer and the remix by FSG was featured in DJ Hero 2 and GoldenEye 007.

The music video for the song was shot in Manchester and features British actor Stephen Graham as well as Warren Brown, Aston Kelly, Greg Walsh & Emma Edmondson. 

The video starts with Graham's character talking to two young men played by Warren Brown & Aston Kelly about rave culture and life. Brown and Kelly's characters then find a place for what is later revealed to be an illegal rave where deadmau5 is performing as the DJ. The video ends with a "to be continued" title card.

Actor Stephen Graham was almost arrested because the police accidentally mistook the music video for an actual illegal rave.
