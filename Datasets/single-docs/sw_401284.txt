360

Year 360 (CCCLX) was a leap year starting on Saturday (link will display the full calendar) of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Constantius and Iulianus (or, less often, year 1113 "Ab urbe condita"). The number 360 for this year has been used since the early Middle Ages, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the main method in Europe for naming years.
