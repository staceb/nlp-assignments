You Know You're Right

"You Know You're Right" is the first song off American grunge band Nirvana's self-titled 2002 compilation album. The song was released on October 8, 2002. It was the last song that was recorded by Nirvana, before Kurt Cobain's death.

On the "Billboard" charts, "You Know You're Right" was able to peak at #1 on the Mainstream Rock, #1 on the Alternative Songs, and #45 on the Hot 100 charts.

There was a legal battle between Cobain's widow Courtney Love and Nirvana bandmates Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic. Both Grohl and Novoselic wanted to use the song for a Nirvana box-set that was planned but Love did not allow this and blocked it from being released. Love said that the song would have been "wasted" by using for a box set, and said that it would be better-suited for a single-disc collection. The lawsuit was settled in September 2002 and it announced that "You Know You're Right" would arrive on "a one-CD history of the band" called "Nirvana" later that year.
