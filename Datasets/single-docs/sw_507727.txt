Government of Manitoba

The government of Manitoba has three parts. The head of state, Elizabeth II, is represented by the Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba. The Lieutenant Governor is appointed by the Governor General of Canada, with the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada.

Manitoba has a unicameral legislature, which is called the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba. It has fifty-seven members, who are elected from single-member districts (meaning that only one member is elected from each district). The largest party in the legislature forms the executive branch. The party leader of the largest party becomes the Premier of Manitoba.

As of 2015, the most recent general election in Manitoba was on October 4, 2011. The New Democratic Party of Manitoba won a majority of seats. On October 19, 2009, Greg Selinger became the Premier.
