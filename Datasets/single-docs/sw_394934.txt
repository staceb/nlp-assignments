Memorial for the Last of Kin

The Memorial for the Last of Kin is a memorial site for the last last remaining Jews from the Holocaust that died in the 1948 Arab–Israeli war without a family. The monument is located in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem in the memory path that connects the National Military and Police Cemetery to Yad Vashem.

The monument was built in 2004 by the sculptor Micha Ullman in two parts. One part is a board with a shape of a roof with names. The second part is a sculpture of reverse house.
