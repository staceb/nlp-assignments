PPG Paints Arena

PPG Paints Arena is a sports arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The arena opened on August 18, 2010, and is the current home of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). It was also home to Pittsburgh Power of the Arena Football League (AFL) from the team's 2011 entry into the league until its demise in 2014.

When it opened, the arena was known as Consol Energy Center, with the naming rights owned by Consol Energy. In October 2016, Consol Energy opted out of its naming rights contract, and PPG Industries took over the naming rights, choosing to promote its paint brand on the arena. The first Penguins game played in the arena was on October 7, 2010 in a 3–2 loss against their rivals, the Philadelphia Flyers.

The arena hosted the Frozen Four in 2013. The first event that happened in the arena was a concert by Paul McCartney. The arena hosted the WWE's Royal Rumble on January 26, 2014.
