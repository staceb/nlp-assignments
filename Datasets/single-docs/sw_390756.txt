Nintendo World Store

The Nintendo World Store is a specialty store that sells Nintendo video games and merchandise. It is located at 10 Rockefeller Center in New York City. It is owned by Nintendo. It opened on May 14, 2005, replacing the Pokémon Center that was there before.

The store is a two-story building. The first floor has Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, and "Pokémon Black 2 and White 2" sections. The second floor has a section with Wii consoles available for anyone to play. In addition, there are also Nintendo 3DS consoles available to play in the store. Some of the things that are sold there are exclusive to the store, meaning that they can only be bought there.

The store holds special tournaments and shows for new games. Early copies of the game and prizes are given out to the winners.
