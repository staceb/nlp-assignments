Bride of Frankenstein

Bride of Frankenstein (sometimes The Bride of Frankenstein) is a 1935 Universal Pictures science fiction horror movie. It is a sequel to Universal's "Frankenstein" (1931). "Bride" was directed by James Whale. It stars Boris Karloff, Elsa Lanchester, Colin Clive, and Ernest Thesiger. 

The movie is based on a subplot in the book "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley. It picks up where the movie "Frankenstein" leaves off. In "Bride", Henry Frankenstein drops his work in the laboratory. The Monster wants a mate. He forces Henry to create one. 

Preparations for making "Bride" began shortly after "Frankenstein" opened in theaters. Photography started in January 1935. Many of the actors and crew from "Frankenstein" returned for "Bride". Critics and audiences loved the movie, but the censors found fault. 

Today, the movie is considered Whale's masterpiece. The director and others involved in the production were homosexuals. Some viewers detect a gay sensibility in the movie. Some of Whale's associates have dismissed the idea.
