Dibutyl sebacate

Dibutyl sebacate (DBS) is an organic compound. It is used as a plasticizer. It is a dibutyl ester of sebacic acid. Its main use is to produce plastics. It can make cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, ethyl cellulose, polyvinyl butyral, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene, and other plastics. These plastics are used in the food packaging industry, in medical devices, and in pharmaceutical applications. For example, it is used as a plasticizer for film coating of tablets, beads, and granules.

It is used make synthetic rubbers (especially nitrile rubber and neoprene). It is also used as a lubricant (something that reduces friction between moving surfaces) in shaving lotions, and a flavoring additive in non-alcoholic beverages, ice cream, ices, candy, and baked goods. DBS works well with a range of plastic materials. It has good properties at low temperatures, and helps plastics from being dissolved by oil. Dibutyl sebacate is also used as a desensitizer in Otto fuel II, a torpedo monopropellant.

DBS is also called Morflex, Kodaflex, polycizer, Proviplast 1944 and PX 404.
