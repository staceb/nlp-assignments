New Labour

New Labour refers to a period in the history of the British Labour Party. This period was from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, under leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The name dates from a conference slogan first used by the party in 1994. This slogan was later seen in a draft manifesto published in 1996, called "New Labour, New Life For Britain". It was presented as the brand of a newly reformed party that had changed Clause IV and supported market economics.
