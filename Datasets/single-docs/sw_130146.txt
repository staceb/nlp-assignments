Cellobiose

Cellobiose is a kind of sugar.

This word is from biochemistry and cellobiose is part of the disaccharide group of sugars. This sugar was called "cellose".

Cellobiose is made from cellulose, which comes from the cells of plants. Things that have a lot of cellulose are good for making cellobiose, like cotton or paper. Water and cellulose make cellobiose: this process is called hydrolysis.

Pure cellobiose is a white powder. 
People cannot metabolize cellobiose.
