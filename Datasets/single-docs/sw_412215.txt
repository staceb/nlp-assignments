Electronic warfare

Electronic warfare is all military techniques for aerial reconnaissance, spying, and radar jamming. In electronic warfare, missiles like AGM-45 Shrike or AGM-88 Harm can be used to destroy radar or communication systems. Examples include deciphering encrypted messages, such as the messages decoded due to the British reverse engineering of the German Enigma.
