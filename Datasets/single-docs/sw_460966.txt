The Last Poets

The Last Poets is the name for several groups of poets and musicians who came out of the late 1960s African-American civil rights movement's black nationalist movement. The name is taken from a poem by the South African revolutionary poet Keorapetse Kgositsile. The Original Last Poets were formed on May 19, 1968 at Marcus Garvey Park in East Harlem. Their first album "The Last Poets" was released in 1970.
