Blind Carbon Copy

Blind Carbon Copy (Bcc) is a way to send emails, like a Carbon Copy (cc). One can use the "Bcc" field to send copies of the email to many recipients. However, unlike a Carbon Copy, only the sender and the Bcc recipient will know who gets the Blind Carbon Copies of the email. Other recipients will not see the Bcc recipient's email address in the mail.
