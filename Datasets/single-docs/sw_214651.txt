London Passenger Transport Board

The London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) was the organisation responsible for public transport in London, England, United Kingdom, and its environs from 1933 to 1948. In common with all London transport authorities from 1933 to 2000, the public name and operational brand of the organisation was London Transport.

The numbering was revised in 1934 after London Passenger Transport Board was formed:
