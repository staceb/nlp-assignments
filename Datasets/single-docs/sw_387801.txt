They have built many coasters around the world. These include "Troy" at Toverland and "El Toro" at Freizeitpark Plohn. Wodan Timbur Coaster has three GCII Millennium Flyer trains. Each has polyurethane wheels instead of the normal steel wheels.

The coaster was named after the Germanic name of the Nordic god Odin. "Timbur" is the Islandic word for "wood". "Timbur Coaster" means "wooden coaster".

The theme of Wodan Timbur Coaster is Norse mythology. The waiting line for the ride uses a large amount of detailed parts. These include fire, mist and water effects. The goddess of death, Hel, is also used. She has a turning sand timer. In the ride station, statues watch the train leave. They also turn to watch the train return to the station. The ride has several dives into tunnels.
