Take Me Away (Avril Lavigne song)

Take Me Away is a song by Canadian singer Avril Lavigne from her second album, "Under My Skin". Like the single before it ("Losing Grip"), "Take Me Away" has an edgy, post-grunge sound and started playing on Canadian rock radio in March of 2004. At around the same time that Don't Tell Me was being promoted, as the lead single from "Under My Skin", "Take Me Away" was being released as the B-side on some copies of the "Don't Tell Me" single. 

"Take Me Away" was released to radio only in Australia in 2005.
