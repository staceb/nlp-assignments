Synchronization

Synchronization is the co-ordination of a set of events into a system that works according to time. For example, a conductor of an orchestra serves to keep the orchestra "in time", or "synchronized". Systems that operate with all their parts in synchrony are said to be "synchronous" or "in sync".

In synchronization, time and order are important. It is used in many everyday systems, including those in transport, computer science, music, multimedia and telecommunication.

Today, synchronization can be done across the world due to digital signals and GPS-enabled time-keeping systems.
