Fire alarm

A fire alarm is a an electronic sounder or a bell. The sounder makes a loud high pitched sound to alert people that there is a fire in the building. The sounders can be programmed to sound different tones. Most fire alarm sounders in Europe sound like a siren. The bell makes a continuous ringing sound. Some companies that make fire alarms are Wheelock and Simplex. There is also Fulleon who are best known for their Roshni electronic sounder. These sounders are often used around Europe and they have 32 user selectable tones. Sometimes, old-fashioned fire alarms are metal bells.. Many fire alarm systems also have flashing lights. These are important for deaf people who cannot hear the fire alarm.

Fire alarms are often used in schools and other places during fire drills. If somebody sets off a fire alarm without a good reason, it is called a "false alarm". Setting off a false alarm is against the law almost everywhere.
