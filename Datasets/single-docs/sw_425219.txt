Vandal-resistant switch

Vandal-resistant switches (sometimes referred to as vandal-proof switches or tamper-proof switches) are electrical switches that are designed to be so strong that people cannot break them. To make switches strong, they are often made out of stainless steel or other durable metals. Buttons are often made so that they do not come very far out. This makes it harder for vandals to pry them out with a screwdriver. Examples of vandal-resistant switches include the buttons that you press to cross the street, the buttons on bank machines, and the buttons on public telephones.
