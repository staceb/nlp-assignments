Premium economy

Premium economy is a travel class offered on some airlines to give better experience than economy class but for much less money than business class. In 1991, EVA Air became the first airline company to offer such a service.

The Premium economy class is not regulated among airlines, and can be much different between airlines and routes. Premium economy is often limited to just small extras like more leg room, free meal and drinks.
