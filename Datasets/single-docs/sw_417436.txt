Pentatomidae

Pentatomidae, Greek "pente" meaning "five" and "tomos" meaning "section", is a family of stink bugs. There are about 4,700 species in the family.

In agriculture, many stink bugs and shield bugs are considered pest insects, because they can damage crops, and are not easily killed by pesticides.
