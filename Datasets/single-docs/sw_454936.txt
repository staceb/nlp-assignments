Fat feminism

Fat feminism is a version of feminism mixed with fat activism. Fat-positive feminists promote the acceptance of women of all sizes. Fat feminism began in second-wave feminism. The field is growing within third-wave feminism.

According to one survey, 56 percent of overweight women are disrespected by their doctors. Forty-six percent say doctors are uncomfortable with the women's weight.

Fat feminists oppose the concept of fixed body images imposed from society. These feminists condemn fat jokes on sitcoms. They also condemn the promotions of skinny figures in Hollywood, on television and on catwalks.

Fat feminists contest the belief one cannot be overweight and fit at the same time.

The movement began in the late 1960s. It has become more popular over the years.
