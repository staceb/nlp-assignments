AFL-NFL Merger

The AFL–NFL merger of 1970 was the merger of the two major professional American football leagues in the United States at the time: the "National Football League" (NFL) and the "American Football League" (AFL). The merger combined the two leagues and retained the "National Football League" name and logo, to become one of the most popular sports leagues in the United States.
