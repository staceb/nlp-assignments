Legal proceeding

A Legal proceeding is any legal matter that is before a judge or tribunal. Legal proceedings refer to all parts of a trial or hearing. 

Legal proceedings for United States courts of appeals are called the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. They apply to all courts of appeal and since December 4, 1967 to the United States Supreme Court.
