Caius or Gaius was a lawyer who lived in the 2nd century. Very little is known about his life, but he left a scholarly work on Roman law, called Institutiones. The Law of Citations, introduced in the year 426 made him one of the authorities of Roman law, together with Ulpian, Paulus, Papianus and Modestinus.

His works were written between AD 130 and 180.
