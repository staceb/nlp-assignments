He started his travel through Japan in 1800. He walked together with his group about 44,000 km to create a map of Japan. When he died in 1818, Takahashi Kageyasu took over and finished the map in 1821.

He was born in Kujukuri, Chiba. When he was 18 years old, he was adopted by the Inou family in Sawara. The Inou family was in a difficult situation because they did not earn much money. However, he ran the family business and it succeeded. When he was 50 years old, he went to Edo to study astronomy because he was interested in it.

In 1800, when he was 55 years old, he went to Hokkaido and started to make a map. After three years, he finished making a map of East Japan. Before making a map, the government opposed him making it but it was very accurate. Therefore, the government ordered him to make a map of West Japan. In 1815, he completed it. 

After his death, some monuments and commemoration were built. For example, Ino Tadataka Anniversary Park in Kujukuri is one of the famous commemorations. In 1995, the Japanese government made a commemorative 80 Yen postage stamp.
