Lake Neusiedl

Lake Neusiedl is the second largest steppe lake in Central Europe. It goes across the Austrian and Hungarian border. The lake covers 315 km². 240 km² is on the Austrian side and 75 km² on the Hungarian side. The lake's drainage basin has an area of about 1,120 km². From north to south, the lake is about 36 km long. It is between 6 km and 12 km wide from east to west. The lake is no more than 1.8 m deep.

Most of the lake is surrounded by reeds which serve as a home for animals. The lake is an important resting place for migratory birds.

In 2001 the national parks in Austria and Fertő-Hanság in Hungary were together accepted as a World Heritage Site.
