Necromancy

Necromancy is a form of divination in which a person tries to summon the spirits of the dead. Necromancy is seen by Christians and Jews as black magic and demon-summoning, as the Book of Leviticus 19:31 says: 'do not turn to mediums or necromancers; do not seek them out and so make yourselves unclean.'
