Chenopodioideae

The Chenopodioideae is a subfamily of flowering plants are family Amaranthaceae, formerly treated as a distinct family Chenopodiaceae and comprising all of the genera formerly included in this family except for those transferred to the subfamilies Salicornioideae and Salsoloideae. The precise circumscription of the subfamily is still uncertain, with research continuing; significant changes may occur to the genera included.

The subfamily as currently circumscribed has a cosmopolitan distribution, with about 1,400 species accepted. It is a particularly significant component of the vegetation of the arid region that extends from north Africa to central Asia.
