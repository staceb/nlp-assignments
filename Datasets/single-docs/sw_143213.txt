Moapa Valley

Moapa Valley is a 40-mile valley and region in the American State of Nevada. Within the valley are four towns: Overton, Logandale, Moapa, and Glendale, Nevada. Logandale and Overton are so close to each other that it is hard to tell them apart without a sign. Moapa Valley was formed by the Muddy River, which flows through it.

Moapa Valley has many archaeological sites, mostly created by the Anasazi Native Americans, which were largely damaged by construction. 

Moapa Valley is also the location of the Lost City Museum, which is a museum displaying artifacts and reconstructed adobe pueblos built on the original sites of the pueblos.
