Endometrial cancer

Endometrial cancer is cancer in the endometrium (lining of the uterus). The cancer is usually diagnosed during its early stages, resulting in a better survival rate than most cancers. Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecologic cancer in the United States: over 35,000 women are diagnosed each year.
