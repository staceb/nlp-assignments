South African Air Force

The South African Air Force (SAAF) is the air force of the South African National Defence Force.

The South African Air Force goes back to 1912, when the Union Defence Force (UDF) was created. The UDF had included the South African Aviation Corps (SAAC), which was part of the Active Citizen Force (ACF). On 1 February 1920, the South African Air Force was created. The SAAF fought in several battles during World War II, the Korean War, and the South African Border War.

The South African Air Force has about 226 aircraft and 11,245 active military personnel. The aircraft are mostly European-made. However some, such as the Denel Rooivalk and the Atlas Oryx were designed and built in South Africa. The Swedish Saab JAS 39 Gripen is the standard aircraft of the Air Force.
