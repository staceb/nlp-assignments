Provisional government

A provisional government is a government set up in an emergency when a political void has been created by the collapse of a government. They are usually unelected and tend to arise after civil or foreign wars. Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord used the term in the early 19th century. The first known establishment of a provisional government was in 1869 by the Métis leader Louis Riel at the Red River Colony.
