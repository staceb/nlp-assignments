Alzette

The Alzette (, ) is a river in France and Luxembourg. It is a right tributary of the Sauer river, and so it is part of the drainage basin of the Rhine river.

The Alzette river is sung in "Ons Heemecht", the national anthem of Luxembourg (, , ).

The Alzette river has a length of but only of them are in France. Its drainage basin has an area of , most of it in Luxembourg.

The Alzette has its source in France in the territory of the "commune" of Thil in the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle (Lorraine), at an altitude of about . It passes through the French "communes" of Villerupt () and Audun-le-Tiche (, .

After a few kilometers, the Alzette enters Luxembourg, flowing through the city of Esch-sur-Alzette (, or "Esch-an-der-Alzig", ). At Lameschmillen (near Bergem) it is joined by the Mess river.

It flows on a wide floodplain before getting into a narrow valley near Hesperange. Then it flows through the Luxembourgish cities of Luxembourg (where it is joined by the Pétrusse river) and Mersch (where is joined by the Mamer and Eisch rivers). It joins, as a right tributary, the Sauer river near Ettelbruck, at about of altitude.

The main tributaries of the Alzette rivers are left tributaries; those that join the river by the right side are very small streams.
