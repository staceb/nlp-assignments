Acrididae

The Acrididae are the main family of grasshoppers, with 10,000 of the 11,000 species of the entire suborder Caelifera. The Acrididae are best known because all locusts (swarming grasshoppers) are of the Acrididae. However, not all Acrididae are locusts: 'locust' is a term which is only given to those grasshoppers which swarm.

Acrididae grasshoppers have relatively short and stout antennae, and drum-like tympana on the side of the first abdominal segment.

The name Acrididae is derived from Greek "akris", meaning locust.
