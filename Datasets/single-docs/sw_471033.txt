Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)

"Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)" is the second single off American punk rock band Green Day's fifth studio album "Nimrod". The song was released on October 17, 1997. The song was first written by lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong before the release of the band's third album "Dookie" in 1994 but the song was not released until Green Day's fifth album, "Nimrod" in 1997.

In 1998, the band were able to win their first MTV Video Music Award for Best Alternative Video. The song was also nominated in the category of Viewer's Choice.

The song has become popular at prom dances, to the band's surprise.
