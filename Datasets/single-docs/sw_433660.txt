Don't Speak

"Don't Speak" is a popular song by No Doubt. The lyrics are about heartache, pain and trouble in relationships. It was released as a single in 1995. The single did not chart on the "Billboard" Hot 100 (rules at the time required that a commercial single were released, one was not issued on the song). It did, however, reach #1 on Hot 100 Airplay for 16 weeks. The song also hit #1 in United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, the Netherlands and New Zealand.

This was the most successful international song from the group.
