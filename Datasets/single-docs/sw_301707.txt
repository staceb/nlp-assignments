Nyctaginaceae

Nyctaginaceae, the four o'clock family, has about 33 genera and 290 species of flowering plants. It grows in tropical and subtropical regions, with a few representatives in temperate regions. It includes plants like the "Bougainvillea" and the four o'clock. Most of the species are vines.

The family has a unique fruit type, called an "anthocarp". Many genera have extremely large (>100 µm) pollen grains.

A curious aspect of "M. jalapa", the four o'clock, is that flowers with different colours grow simultaneously on the same plant.
