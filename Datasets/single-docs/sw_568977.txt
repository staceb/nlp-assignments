The Mirage

The Mirage is a 3,044 room hotel and casino resort located on the strip in Las Vegas, Nevada. The casino is owned by MGM Mirage. 

The Mirage has a 20,000-gallon saltwater aquarium with over 450 species of fish. It has an indoor tropical rainforest housed in its tall atrium. In front of the Mirage is a volcano that erupts nightly depending on the season. Every hour there is a fire show. The huge balls of fire are choreographed to music and light up the lagoon next to it. 

The Mirage is connected by a free tram to Treasure Island, its sister property immediately to the north.
