2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot

The 2011 Vancouver Stanley Cup riot was a riot that took place on June 15, 2011 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

The riot took place after the Boston Bruins defeated the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. It happened immediately after the Bruins defeated the Canucks. There were at least 140 people that were reported as being injured in the incident, one critically and at least four people were stabbed. Close to 100 people were arrested.

People were angry over the result of the final game and threw objects at the large screens that were at the viewing area. They set fire to Boston Bruins flags, overturned and set fire to two vehicles in front of the main Canada Post headquarters. There were reports of similar car fires in a nearby parking garage that included two police cruisers. The rioters smashed windows and looted stores. The riot ended around midnight when people in the crowd either went home or were arrested. The mayor of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson, called the rioters "a small group of troublemakers". Several of the participants in the riot turned themselves in to the police after their faces were shown on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. According to CBC News, the destruction caused by the rioters was worse than the riot that followed the Canucks loss in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, especially the looting aspect.
