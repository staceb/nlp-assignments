Ericales

The Ericales are a large and diverse order of dicotyledons, including for example azalea ("Rhododendron"), blueberry ("Vaccinium myrtillus"), grass tree ("Dracophyllum"), lúcuma ("Pouteria lucuma"), kiwifruit ("Actinidia deliciosa"), and tea ("Camellia sinensis"). The order includes trees and bushes, lianas and herbaceous plants.

Many species have five petals, fused together. This was used to place the order in the subclass Sympetalae.

Mycorrhiza is often found in Ericales.
