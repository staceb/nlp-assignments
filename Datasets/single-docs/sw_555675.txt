Startup company

A startup company (startup or start-up) is a new and fast-growing company. They try to meet a marketplace need, offering an innovative product, process or service. 

A start-up is usually a small business, a partnership or an organization. Rapid growth is what they aim for. Often, startup companies use the internet, e-commerce, computers, and telecommunications.

The term became fashionable in the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when a great number of internet-based companies were formed.
