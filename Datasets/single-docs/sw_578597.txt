Hroðgar

Hrothgar is a character in the epic poem Beowulf. He is the king of Denmark and in the poem, his kingdom is under attack from the monster Grendel. When the warrior Beowulf arrives, he battles and slays the monster when he attacks the king's mead hall Heorot. After a night of celebrating, Grendel's mother attacks in retaliation for her son's death. Beowulf tracks her down to her lair and slays her, after which he returns to his native Geatland. Nothing is stated about Hrothgar after these events, but he presumably passes away.
