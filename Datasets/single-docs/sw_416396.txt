Mini-bar

A mini-bar is a small refrigerator in a hotel room with drinks in it. They are usually found in expensive and sometimes mid-range hotel rooms and may have things like soft drinks, wine and beer. The hotel usually charges to use it, and prices are usually very high.

Many mini-bars automatically charge money if drinks are removed, even if you do not drink them.
