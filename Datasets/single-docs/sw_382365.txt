Thomas Fuller

Thomas Fuller (1608-1661) was an English writer, historian and clergyman.

After taking a Master of Arts degree from Cambridge University he decided to join the church. He used to write to share his ideas with people.

He wrote many books like "The History of the Holy War" (1639), "The Holy State and Profane State" (1642), "Good Thoughts in Bad Times" (1645), "Good Thoughts in Worse Times" (1647), "A History of the University of Cambridge" (1659) and "Mixed Contemplations in Better Times" (1660). 

Thomas Fuller strongly supported the English Royalist party and was very loyal to King Charles I of England. He suffered a lot after his defeat but later on, after the English Restoration, he became Chaplain to King Charles II of England.
