Lee Chaolan

Lee Chaolan is a video game character in "Tekken". The first time he was in Tekken was the first Tekken game.

Lee Chaolan was an orphan before the first game started, but was adopted as a child by Heihachi Mishima.

Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi's son, was Lee's arch nemesis since they were children. Kazuya always won against Lee. Lee is now in a world of hate because of this experience. He holds a constant grudge against Kazuya. 

Lee Chaolan's fighting style uses mostly feet. Using his long legs and quick feet, he can take down any foe that comes his way. Kazuya uses a balanced force of fist and foot to take down his foes. Balance is Kazuya's key to victory over his rival Lee.

He turned 48 in Tekken 5 but the creators made him look younger.
