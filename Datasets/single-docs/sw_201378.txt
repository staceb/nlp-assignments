Jacques Villeneuve

Jacques Joseph Charles Villeneuve, OQ (born April 9, 1971 in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec) is a Canadian automobile racing driver. He is the son of Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve, and is the namesake of his uncle (also a racer).

He raced in Formula One from 1996 to 2006, driving for Williams, BAR, Renault and BMW Sauber. He won the world championship in 1997 with Williams, in only his second season, the first person to do so that quickly (except for the 1950 season, the very first season in F1).
