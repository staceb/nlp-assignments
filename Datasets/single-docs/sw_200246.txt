Douglas C-47 Skytrain

The C-47 Skytrain was an American cargo aircraft that could carry up to 3.5 tons. It was the military version of the DC-3. The C-47 was most notably used during World War II by the Allied to move troops, supplies and the wounded.

During the Berlin Airlift in the Cold War C-47 planes carried food and other supplies to West Berlin, as all other methods of transport were blocked.
