Guide skier

A guide skier is a person who helps skiers who cannot see by telling them where to go. They communicate by using a radio or talking to them. The guide skier can see.

Skiers can use more than one guide during a race type. The guide can only win a medal if they raced with the same skier for the whole race type. Like the skier, the guide has to have an IPCAS Licence in order to compete in races. Guide skiers need to follow to anti-doping rules.

Skiers follow the guide skier in the biathlon.
