Hilary Bradt

Hilary Bradt MBE (born 17 July 1941) is a British writer. He founded "Bradt Travel Guides", a publisher of travel guide books, in the mid-1970s.

From 1972, Bradt spent 18 months in South America with her husband, and later they set up "Bradt Travel Guides" together. Their first book was "Backpacking along Ancient Ways in Peru and Bolivia". The award-winning Bradt guides have always covered unusual destinations that do not attract large numbers of tourists. The company is based in Chalfont St Peter, England.

After running the company for 35 years, Bradt retired in 2007, but she is still chairman. She also still writes about travel, including a guide book to Devon and articles in travel magazines.

Bradt worked for many years as a tour leader, particularly in Madagascar, a country that she has written many books about. Bradt is a member of the British Guild of Travel Writers and she received their Lifetime Achievement Award in November 2009.

She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2008 Queen's Birthday Honours for services to the tourist industry and to charity. Bradt's charity work includes being patron of Money for Madagascar, which has been raising funds for projects in Madagascar since 1986.
