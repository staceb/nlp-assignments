Atrial-natriuretic peptide

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide (ANP) (also called atrial natriuretic factor and atrial natriuretic hormone) is a vasodilator and a hormone. It is produced by the brain in response to increased blood pressure. It inhibits renin, an enzyme produced by the juxtaglomerular apparatus. This causes you to secrete more salt and water.
