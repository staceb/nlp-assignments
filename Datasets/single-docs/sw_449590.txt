Palaeothere

Palaeotheres are an extinct group of herbivorous mammals. They are related to tapirs and rhinoceros, and probably ancestral to horses. They ranged across Europe and Asia during the Eocene and Oligocene 5528 million years ago.

They were small to medium-sized. They lived in dense forests. They ate soft leaves, shoots, berries, and leaf matter picked up from the forest floor.
