Provinces of Belgium

Belgium is divided into three regions (Flemish Region, Walloon Region and Brussels-Capital Region), two of them are subdivided into five provinces each.

Because the German-speaking Community is found in the Province of Liège, people want a third province: the Province of Eupen-Sankt Vith, which would be made up of the 9 municipalities of the German-speaking Community.
