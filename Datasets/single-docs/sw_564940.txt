Indian Act

The Indian Act ("An Act respecting Indians"), is a Canadian statute that concerns registered Indians, their bands, and the system of Indian reserves. It was first passed in 1876 and is still in force with amendments. It is the primary document which governs how the Canadian state interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members. Throughout its long history, the Act has been an ongoing source of controversy. It has been interpreted in many ways by both aboriginal and non-aboriginal Canadians. The legislation has been amended many times, including "over twenty major changes" made by 2002.
