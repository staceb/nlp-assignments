Jaws (novel)

Jaws is a 1974 American novel by Peter Benchley. It is about a great white shark that eats several people in the ocean near a small town in Long Island, New York. Three men set out on a boat to hunt and kill the shark. Benchley was partly inspired by the adventures of a shark fisherman named Frank Mundus.

Millions of copies of the novel were sold. In 1975, a movie based on the book, also called "Jaws", was released. The movie was directed by Steven Spielberg.
