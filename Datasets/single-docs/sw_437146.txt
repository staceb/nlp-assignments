Brent Hayden

Brent Matthew Hayden (born October 21, 1983 in Mission, British Columbia) is a Canadian retired swimmer. 

During the 100-metre freestyle event at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London he won the bronze medal for Canada. He became the first Canadian in 21 years to win a gold medal at the World Aquatics Championships. He was also the first Canadian to appear in the 100-metre final at the Olympics since Dick Pound appeared at the 1960 Summer Olympics. He was also the first Canadian to win an Olympic medal in the 100 m event.

After the men's 4 × 100-metre medley relay at the Olympics, Hayden announced that he was retiring. He said he believed in the Canadian swim team to thrive in the future, saying that "I think in the grand scheme of things, with the people we have, we’ve done an amazing job … As long as we keep that momentum building, I think we’re going to see more success come from more diverse events."
