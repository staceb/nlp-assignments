Defense Support Program

The Defense Support Program (DSP) is a group of satellites that orbit the Earth. They are owned by the United States Air Force to run the "Satellite Early Warning System" used by the United States. DSP satellites are used to detect missile and spacecraft launches. DSP is also used to detect nuclear explosions. It does this by using infrared sensors on the satellite.
