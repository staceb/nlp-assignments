Nadya Suleman

Nadya Denise Suleman (or Natalie Denise Suleman; born on July 11, 1975), called Octomom in the media, is an American mother. She came to worldwide attention in January 2009 when she gave birth to octuplets (eight babies).

Public reaction became very negative, however, when it was discovered she already had six children and was not employed. She also received welfare. Suleman conceived the octuplets through in vitro fertilization. 

Suleman is also a dancer.
