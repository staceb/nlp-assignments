Explode (song)

"Explode" is a song recorded by American musician Patrick Stump. The track is the opening song on his debut studio album "Soul Punk". The song was leaked on his YouTube channel on May 6, 2011 for promotion towards his album.

On May 6, 2011, Stump updated his website and also posted to his Facebook and Twitter, announcing "I feel like I'm gonna explode 5.9.11". The phrase came from a song called "Explode", which Stump had premiered at a live show. The new song was revealed on May 9, 2011. Stump released the song on a website called "Vulture". "NyMag.com" commented that the song is a lot like the music of Michael Jackson. They also said that it was similar to the music of Stump's old band, Fall Out Boy. The song's video caption, which read ""Soul Punk": coming late Summer", was Stump's first official announcement to the public regarding "Soul Punk"'s release date.

"Idolator" reported that "Explode" features Stump's unique, recognisable vocals and the clever wordplay that used to be expected from Pete Wentz.
