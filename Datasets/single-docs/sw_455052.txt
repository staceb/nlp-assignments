Minguo calendar

The Republic of China calendar () is a method of numbering years. It is used by TAIWAN as well as other territories which are under control of the Republic of China. The Minguo calendar was also used by Mainland China from 1912 until the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949. There have been legislative proposals by pro-Taiwan Independence parties, like the Democratic Progressive Party to get rid of the Republican calendar and replace it with the Gregorian calendar.
