Deathstroke

Deathstroke (Slade Joseph Wilson) is a fictional supervillain appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by Marv Wolfman and George Perez. 

He is a mercenary and assassin who first appeared in "The New Teen Titans" (vol. 1) #2 (1980). "Wizard" magazine rated him the 24th greatest villain of all time. Also, in 2009, Deathstroke was ranked as IGN's 32nd greatest comic book villain of all time.

Originally the archenemy of the Teen Titans, writers have developed him over the years as a villain of other heroes in the DC Universe; parallels have been established between him and Batman, and he has a deep-seated grudge against Green Arrow. The character has been adapted from the comics into multiple forms of media, including several "Batman" related projects and the "Teen Titans" animated series.

Deathstroke later appeared on The CW's live action TV series "Arrow", where he is portrayed by Manu Bennett. Joe Manganiello has been cast as Deathstroke for the DC Extended Universe movie series.
