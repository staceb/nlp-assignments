Black Friday (Lil' Kim mixtape)

Black Friday is the second mixtape by American rapper Lil' Kim, released on February 14, 2011. The mixtape is a parody of fellow female rapper Nicki Minajs 2010 album "Pink Friday" in which Minaj takes shots at Kim on several songs such as "Roman's Revenge" and "Did it On 'Em". Kim's artwork features a picture of Kim with a sword that had just been used to behead Minaj. The title track also is a diss song aimed at Minaj as Kim imitates Minaj talking about Kim on her song "Roman's Revenge" in an interview. The album also includes vocals from Minaj and R&B singers Rihanna and Keri Hilson.
