Game artist

A game artist is an artist who creates art for video games. Game artists are in charge of all game development of visual art.

Many game artists are asked to develop graphical environments and elements in which role-playing games take place. For example, in the "Monster Manual" early "Dungeons & Dragons" artists created visual imitations of monsters players might see while playing the video game.

Visual art can help make the gameplay of a video game more appealing to a player. Art for role-playing games can be expressed in a lot of different ways. These can include from pencil drawings, pen and ink drawings, oil paintings or even 3D models created with a computer.
