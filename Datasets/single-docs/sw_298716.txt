Window (computing)

In computing, a window is an area on a computer screen. This area usually shows an application or folder. Windows can be made bigger or smaller, and can be opened or closed. They can also be minimized. They are usually in the shape of a rectangle.

Windows are very obvious in graphical user interfaces as they are the main means of displaying information to users. The most famous of these is the appropriately named "Windows" operating system made by Microsoft.
