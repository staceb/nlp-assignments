Eastcote

Eastcote is a suburban area in west London. (It was in Middlesex until the county was abolished in 1965). It is part of the London Borough of Hillingdon. In the Middle Ages, Eastcote was one of the three areas that made up the parish of Ruislip, under the name of Ascot. The name came from its position to the east of the parish. From the mid-17th century there were clusters of small hamlets in this area.
