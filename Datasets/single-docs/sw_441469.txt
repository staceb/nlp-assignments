Egon Bahr

Egon Karl-Heinz Bahr (18 March 1922 – 20 August 2015) was a German SPD politician.

During World War II Bahr was expelled from the Wehrmacht because he was partly of Jewish descent.

After the war he worked as a journalist and a diplomat before entering into politics.

Bahr was promoted by West German Chancellor Willy Brandt to serve as Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office from 1969 until 1972. Between 1972 and 1990 he was an MP in the Bundestag of the Federal Republic of Germany and from 1972 until 1976 was also a Minister of the Federal Government.
