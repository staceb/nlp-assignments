Jaguarundi

The jaguarundi ("Puma yagouaroundi") is a small wild cat native to Central and South America. It is a smaller relative of the better-known cougar, and has many local names.

The cat is still widespread throughout the Amazon Basin, and is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List since 2002. It is sometimes found in Mexico and southern Texas, and as far south as northern Argentina.

Jaguarundis are mostly daytime animals. They are comfortable in trees, but hunt on the ground.

According to a 2006 genomic study of Felidae, an ancestor of today's "Leopardus", "Lynx", "Puma", "Prionailurus", and "Felis" lines migrated across the Bering land bridge into the Americas about 8.0 to 8.5 million years ago.
