Potassium bromide

Potassium bromide is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is KBr. It contains potassium and bromide ions.

It is a white crystalline solid. It dissolves easily in water. When it is dilute, it tastes sweet; when it is a little concentrated, it tastes bitter; when it is very concentrated, it tastes salty. This taste is because of the potassium ion. 

It can be made by reacting hydrogen bromide with potassium carbonate or potassium hydroxide. It can also be made by reacting bromine and potassium metal. This is very difficult, though.

It is used to put people to sleep (sedative). It is also used to stop convulsions. This is because of the bromide ion, not the potassium ion. It is used to make silver bromide. It is used to treat various animals. 

Bromide ions can be toxic in large amounts. Potassium ions can burn, similar to salt when someone eats too much.
