Rock of Ages Corporation

Rock of Ages Corporation is a company in Vermont. It mines granite, which it sells largely for use in memorials, though it also makes smaller products.

It was started in 1885, and has its headquarters in Graniteville, Vermont, which is close to Barre.

There are around 230 people who work for the company. Rock of Ages had a profit of about $800,000 in 2008.

In October 2010, another mining company, Swenson Granite Company, said it would buy Rock of Ages for $39 million.
