Division of Watson

The Division of Watson is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It was set up for the 1993 election to replace the abolished Division of St George. It is named after Chris Watson, the first Labor Prime Minister of Australia. 

The division is located in the southern suburbs of Sydney, including Belfield, Belmore, Burwood Heights, Campsie, Chullora, Clemton Park, Enfield, Greenacre, Lakemba, Mount Lewis, Roselands, Strathfield South and Wiley Park and parts of Ashbury, Bankstown, Beverly Hills, Burwood, Canterbury, Croydon, Croydon Park, Earlwood, Kingsgrove, Narwee, Punchbowl, Riverwood and Strathfield.

There was an earlier Division of Watson (1934-69). It was in the south-eastern suburbs of Sydney, however that Division is not connected to this one except in name.

Leo McLeay was Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives.
