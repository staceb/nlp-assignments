Freiberg, Saxony

Freiberg (i.e. "free mountain") is a town in the Free State of Saxony, Germany, capital of the Freiberg Rural District.

The town was founded in 1186, and has been a centre of the mining industry in the Ore Mountains for centuries.

In 1944 the Flossenburg concentration camp built a subcamp outside the town of Freiberg. It housed over 500 female survivors of other camps, including Auschwitz Birkenau. Altogether 50 or so SS women worked in this camp until its evacuation in April 1945. The female survivors later reached the Mauthausen concentration camp in Austria.
