Grave

A grave is where somebody or something is buried after they have died.
Graves are usually placed in a graveyard, with a headstone used to identify the dead person.
A funeral will occur if the family has enough money. If they do not, there will not be a proper funeral. The name on the grave is of the dead person. For example, William Shakespeare was buried in England.
