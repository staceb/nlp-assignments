Hull, Florida

Hull, Florida is an unincorporated community in Southwest DeSoto County, Florida. About 150 people live there.

Hull had a creosote tie treating plant for the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railroad. The railroad was bought by the Seaboard Air Line Railroad in the 1920s. The Seaboard Railroad kept using the creosote plant through the 1950s. In the late 1920s, Hull became the junction of a new line of the SAL to Fort Myers and Naples. Passenger service was done on the branch. This line was stopped in 1953.
