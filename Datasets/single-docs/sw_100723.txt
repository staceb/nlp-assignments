Birthmark

A birthmark is a mark on skin that some people are born with. Names given to types of birthmarks are: stork bites, Mongolian blue spots, strawberry marks, café au lait spots, nevus|congenital melanocytic nevi, and port-wine stains.

A birthmark was once thought of as the mark of the devil, and today it is often considered a birth defect. In some cases this mark is considered to be the mark of God applied to his chosen few.
