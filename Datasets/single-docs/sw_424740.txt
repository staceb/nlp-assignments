Nostalgia, Ultra

Nostalgia, Ultra is the debut mixtape album by recording artist Frank Ocean. It was released in February 2011 as a free digital download on Ocean's website. It featured the successful singles "Novacane" and "Swim Good". It was supposed to be reissued as an extended play, but this was cancelled. The mixtape caught the attention of rappers Kanye West and Jay-Z, who got Ocean as a featured artist on their "Watch The Throne" album. The mixtape caused controversy in March 2012 because of the track "American Wedding", which is a remake of "Hotel California" by The Eagles.
