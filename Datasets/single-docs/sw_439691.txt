Trypanosomatida

The Trypanosomatida are a group of unicellular kinetoplastids. They have a single flagellum, and often live as parasites. Many trypanosomatids only live in insects. Some change hosts: one form lives in insects, the other lives inside a plant or an animal. "Leishmania" is a common example.
