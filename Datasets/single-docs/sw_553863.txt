In "Montecoronaro", a "frazione" (an Italian subdivision of a municipality) of Verghereto, the river takes the name of "Savio". The river flows through the communes of Bagno di Romagna and San Piero in Bagno and, after a few kilometres, it forms an artificial reservoir, the "Lago di Quarto", where it is joined, on the right side, by its first important tributary, the stream "Para".

It flows through the communes of Sarsina, Mercato Saraceno and Cesena, all in the province of Forlì-Cesena. In "Botello" (a "frazione" of Cesena), it is joined on the left side by its main tributary, the stream "Botello". Then it goes into the province of Ravenna and flows through "Castiglione di Cervia" (commune of Cervia) and "Castiglione di Ravenna" (commune of Ravenna).

Finally, after 126 kilometres, it flows into the Adriatic Sea between Lido di Classe, a seaside resort, and Lido di Savio.

The tributaries of the Savio are all small streams; the main are the Botello, left tributary, and Para, coming from the right.
