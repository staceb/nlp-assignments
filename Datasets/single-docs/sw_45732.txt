Maloideae

The Maloideae (which is a Latin plural form) is a traditional name for a subfamily of plants in the rose family (Rosaceae). These plants are shrubs and small trees. The most well known Maloideae are apples and pears. Recently it has been shown that the Maloideae are a part of the traditional subfamily Amygdaloideae, and most botanists no longer use the name Maloideae.
