Centre (ice hockey)

Centre (center in the United States) is a position in ice hockey. A centre plays in the middle of the ice as one of three forwards. The centre is between the left wing and the right wing, and is the one who takes faceoffs. Because they are in the middle, the centre sometimes has to help the two defencemen when they need help.
