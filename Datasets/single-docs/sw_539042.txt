Pathum Thani Province

Pathum Thani (, ) is one of the central provinces ("changwat") of Thailand.

The province is north of Bangkok.

Many canals are in the province. They are used to feed the rice paddies.

In 1815, King Rama II visited the city. He was given a lot of lotus flowers. Because of this, the king decided to rename the city to "Pathum Thani". It means "the lotus flower town".
Pathum Thani has a very high concentration of higher education institutions, especially ones in the field of science and technology. This, together with a large number of industrial parks and research facilities (including those in Thailand Science Park), make the region the educational and technology hub of the area.
