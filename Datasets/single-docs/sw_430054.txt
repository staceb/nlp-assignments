Busbar

A busbar (or bus bar) is a strip of metal used to conduct electricity within an electrical substation, distribution board, electric switchboard or other electrical equipment. A busbar is usually a flat or hollow piece of copper, brass or aluminium. It allows heat to be released quickly because of its relatively large surface area.
