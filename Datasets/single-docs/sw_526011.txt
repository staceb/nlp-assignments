Because You Loved Me

"Because You Loved Me" is a 1996 pop-R&B ballad by Canadian singer Celine Dion. Its lyrics are about the protagonist thanking a loyal loved one for guiding, encouraging and protecting her and for making her who she is. It was originally written for the movie "Up Close and Personal". Diane Warren, who wrote the song (and others for artists like Cher, Aerosmith, Monica, and Lady Gaga), said the song was a tribute to her father. "Because You Loved Me" won Warren a Grammy Award for Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media.

"Because You Loved Me" is the second track on Dion's album "Falling into You". The song topped the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100 for six weeks and finished as the third-best performing song of 1996 there. It also reached number one in Canada and Australia and reached number five in the UK. It was certified Platinum in the US for sales and shipments of over one million copies.
