Jim Schwartz

Jim Schwartz is an American Football head coach for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League. A Maryland native, Schartz eventually rose to notable coaching positions. Before the 2009 NFL season, Schartz left his post as the defensive coordinator of the Tennessee Titans and became the head coach of the Detroit Lions, who went 0-16 the year before. Sschartz got Detroit to the playoffs in 2011.

In a game against the San Francisco 49ers (49ers win) in 2011, a postgame handshake made national news. In the game, San Francisco head coach Jim Harbaugh challenged a scoring play. However, under NFL rules, scoring plays are always reviewed. Schwartz reportedly screamed a curse. After the 49ers won, the coaches went to midfield to shake hands. However, Schwartz accused Harbaugh of "smacking his back and shaking his hand too hard." Shartz chased Harbaugh down the field, and they had to be separated. This is often called "The Handshake Game."
