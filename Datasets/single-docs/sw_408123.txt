Butler

A butler is a male domestic worker in a large household with several employees.

The butler is the chief servant, responsible for the day-to-day management of the house and the other servants. In a traditional house the butler, who is always male, directs the male servants, while a housekeeper, a woman, directs the female servants. Traditionally, male servants (such as valets and footmen) were better paid and of higher status than female servants.
