Quarterback sack

A quarterback sack is a move in American football. A defender rushes past the line of scrimmage and tackles the quarterback for a loss of yardage. In the National Football League, New York Giants defensive end Michael Strahan made 22.5 sacks in the 2002 season alone, which remains a record.
