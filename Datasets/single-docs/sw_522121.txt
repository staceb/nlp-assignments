Black garlic

Black garlic is a type of food which is made by heating whole bulbs of garlic over the course of several weeks. It was first used as a food ingredient in Asian cuisine. The taste is sweet and syrupy with hints of balsamic vinegar or tamarind. 
Black garlic's popularity has spread to the United States because it has become a sought-after ingredient used in high-end cuisine. The ornamental plant "Allium nigrum" is commonly called black garlic.
