Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec is a Catholic archdiocese in the province of Quebec, Canada. It was started in 1658 as an Apostolic vicariate. Pope Clement X made it a diocese in 1674. At the time, the diocese covered all of New France. Starting in 1817, parts of the diocese were split off into new dioceses. In 1819, it became an archdiocese.

The Archdiocese of Quebec is the ecclesiastical provincial for three other dioceses in Quebec: Chicoutimi, Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière, and Trois-Rivières.

The current archbishop of Quebec is Gérald Lacroix, who was appointed in 2011.
