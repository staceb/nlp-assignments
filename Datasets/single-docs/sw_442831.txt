Bert Gardiner

Wilbert Homer Gardiner (March 25, 1913 – August 28, 2001) was a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender. Gardiner played 144 games in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played with the Montreal Canadiens, Chicago Black Hawks, Boston Bruins, and New York Rangers. 

Before he played in the NHL, he played with the Philadelphia Arrows of the CAHL and the Crescent-Hamilton A.C. of the Eastern Hockey League. He also played with the Philadelphia Ramblers of the CAHL/IAHL, the New Haven Eagles of the IAHL, and the Washington Lions of the AHL.

When Dave Kerr got injured in Game 1 of the 1939 Stanley Cup Finals, the Bruins called up Gardiner from Philadelphia to replace him. Gardiner played in the final six games of the finals.

Gardiner retired from professional ice hockey in 1944. He died on August 28, 2001 in Los Angeles, California.
