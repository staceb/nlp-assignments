Jasmine Directory

Jasmine Directory is a human-edited, partly for money web directory listing websites by topic and by region. This list offers a range of thirteen topics and one region-based list with hand-picked and reviewed users' suggested resources.

The project was created in 2006 at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics by Pecsi Andras and Robert Gombos and shown to the public in 2009. It was developed using a core code created by TOLRA Micro Systems Ltd.

In 2013 and 2014, Ken Anderson—editor at the Magic City Morning Star, early meta editor for the Open Directory Project (DMOZ), and editor at Go.com and Zeal directories—rated Jasmine Directory in his "Top Ten Web Directories", where each directory is reviewed quarterly.

Currently, Jasmine Directory is based in Valley Cottage, New York.

Jasmine Directory's editors add resources to the index by hand. Website owners can also suggest their websites for review by paying a fee. However, inclusion is not guaranteed if the suggested websites don't comply with the rules from the editors.

Because editors review every listing, search engines view listings in "quality directories" as valuable. Website owners report that submitting their sites to web directories can be worthwhile.

Ann Smarty—search marketer and writer at "Entrepreneur", Mashable, and Moz—mentions Jasmine Directory as providing a ""valuable user experience"".

The company claims that review by editors is key in maintaining a neutral and useful index of information that doesn't depend on how any single user sees things, as Matt Cutts mentioned in 2011.
