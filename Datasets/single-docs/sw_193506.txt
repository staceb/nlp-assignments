Milang, South Australia

Milang is small town that is found on the shores of Lake Alexandrina, just over 20 kms from Strathalbyn, South Australia.

The town was laid out in December 1853. Milang was a very important port on the Murray River System between 1860 and 1880, before the railway line was built to connect Adelaide to Morgan farther upstream.
