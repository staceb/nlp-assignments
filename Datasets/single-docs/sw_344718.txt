Exuma

Exuma is a district of the Bahamas. It has over 360 islands. The largest of the cays is Great Exuma. It is joined to another island, Little Exuma by a small bridge. The capital and largest city in the district is George Town. The entire island chain is 130 mi (209 km) long and 27 sq. mi (72 km²) in area.

In 1783, American loyalists running from the Revolutionary War came to the island.

The islands are a popular spot for yachting, sailing, diving, and coral reef and cave exploring. Many of the unnamed beaches and coves of the islands are in the Exuma National Land and Sea Park.
