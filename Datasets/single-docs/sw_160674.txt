British Rail Class D3/7

British Railways Class D3/7 were diesel shunters built from May 1939 through to July 1942 by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at their Derby Works. Like the earlier British Rail Class D3/6, they had the English Electric 6K diesel engine of . But a big change was having a "Jackshaft" type of connection between engine and wheels (like a diesel mechanical shunter). These were given LMS numbers 7080–7119. Ten were loaned to the War Department in 1941, and sold to the WD the following year. All ten survived the war; six were then sold to Egyptian Railways and four to Italian State Railways (Ferrovie dello Stato—FS).
