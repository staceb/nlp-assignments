Ennepe-Ruhr Rural District

The Ennepe-Ruhr-Kreis is a district in the middle of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

The old district was changed in 1970 and 1975. It now includes the city of Witten.

The district got its name because it is in the valleys of the rivers Ruhr and Ennepe.

In the middle of the coat of arms there is the checked red-white bar of the medieval state of Mark, which owned the area in medieval times. The two wavy lines above and below are for the two rivers which gave the district its name, the Ruhr and the Ennepe.
