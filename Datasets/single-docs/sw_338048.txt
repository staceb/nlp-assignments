Bother (song)

"Bother" is the second single from the alternative metal band Stone Sour's first album "Stone Sour". It was originally released as a solo song by frontman Corey Taylor, but the billing was later changed to Stone Sour. The song was one of Stone Sour's first songs to put them into the mainstream. The cover features Taylor's hands and rings, one of them being a Spider-Man ring which is a reference to the song being featured on the soundtrack to the film "Spider-Man" (although the track is credited to Taylor as the performer not Stone Sour) and to Taylor being a fan of Spider-Man. The other has the number 8 on it, representing Taylor's number in Slipknot. Taylor has stated that the song is about when he moved back to Des Moines from Denver, where he hoped to try to move forward with his music.
