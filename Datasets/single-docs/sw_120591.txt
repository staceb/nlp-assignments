Together they decided to create a site that would resolve those issues, for a more simple method of transferring these files and other media.On October 2006 MediaFire was actually launched, and did rather well with producing a site where user of all ages could share files with ease and feel secure about their files. And this site only continued to grow, and more features were invented such as:

Unlimited cloud Storage, Branding tools and the ability to share files with friends and family and other users.
