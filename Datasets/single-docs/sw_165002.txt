Thammasat University

Thammasat University (TU) is the second oldest university in Thailand. It was established on June 27, 1934. The university was initially named, by Dr. Pridi Banomyong, ‘Vichar Thammasat Lae Karn Muang’ – ‘The University of Moral Science and Politics’. At that time, there was only Chulalongkorn University in Thailand, so he thought that the university should have people who have knowledge of law, administration and social. It had started out as an open university, with 7,094 people for the first academic year. The main goal of the university’s foundation was "to teach students to love and cherish democracy". Only in the year 1952 was the name ‘Vichar Thammasat Lae Karn Muang’ changed to the present day ‘Thammasat University’.
