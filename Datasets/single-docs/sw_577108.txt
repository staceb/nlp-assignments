Miloslav Vlk

Miloslav Vlk ([ˈmɪloslaf ˈvl̩k]; 17 May 1932 – 18 March 2017) was a Czech prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as Archbishop of Prague from 1991 to 2010. He was made a cardinal in 1994.

Vlk has been sharply critical of the rise of far-right and xenophobic sentiment in Central Europe, joining Jewish protests in 2007 when right-wingers planned a march through Prague's Jewish quarter on the anniversary of Kristallnacht.

Vlk was born in the Písek District of Southern Bohemia. He died on 18 March 2017 from cancer in Prague, aged 84.
