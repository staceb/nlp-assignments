Kalka, South Australia

Kalka is an Aboriginal community in the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Lands in South Australia. It is by road from Pipalyatjara, at the base of the Tomkinson Ranges. There were 114 people living at Kalka in 2006.

Kalka was originally planned as a service centre for surrounding outstations, but by the early 1990s it had developed into a small permanent community. The town has basic facilities. A truck brings food and supplies to the community every two weeks. There is no school or health clinic at Kalka; both of these services are supplied at nearby Pipalyatjara. There is an unsealed airstrip near to the town.
