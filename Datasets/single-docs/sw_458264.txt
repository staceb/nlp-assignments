Soccer kick

A soccer kick, also known as a soccer ball kick, is a kick that is close to kicks used in association football. It is the term for a kick performed against a kneeling, rising or on the ground opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, mostly to the head of the opponent on the ground. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau used a soccer kick to win the match against Teila Tuli. The soccer kick also knocked out some of Tuli's teeth.
