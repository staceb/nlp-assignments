Thermophile

A thermophile is an organism – a type of extremophile – that thrives at relatively high temperatures. That means between about . Many thermophiles are archaea. Thermophilic eubacteria may have been among the earliest bacteria.

Thermophiles are found in various geothermally heated parts of the Earth's surface. Examples are hot springs like those in Yellowstone National Park (see image) and deep sea hydrothermal vents. Also decaying plant matter, such as peat bogs and compost, makes higher temperatures.
