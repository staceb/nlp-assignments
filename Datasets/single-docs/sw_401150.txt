Andhrímnir

Andhrímnir is the chef of the gods in Norse mythology. He is the god that killed the mighty boar Sæhrímnir. He cooks Sæhrímnir in his cauldron named Eldhrímnir. The cooked beast is then fed to the gods and fallen warriors in Valhalla. At night, the boar comes back to life so Andhrímnir can kill him and cook him again. This way, the gods and fallen warriors eat well until Ragnarok.
