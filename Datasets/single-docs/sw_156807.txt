Beehive

A beehive is a structure in which some species of honey bees (genus "Apis") live and raise their young. Natural beehives (or "nests") are made by honey bee colonies, while domesticated honey bees are kept in man-made beehives in a location known as an apiary. The beehives made by people are usually the things referred to by the word "beehive."

Beehives have hexagonal cells in them, packed together. This is called a honeycomb.
