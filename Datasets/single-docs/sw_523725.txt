Kirthar Mountains

The Kirthar Mountains are in Balochistan and the Sindh provinces of Pakistan. The range extends south for about 190 miles (300 km) from the Mula River in east-central Balochistan to Cape Monze (Muari), near Mubarak Village, Karachi on the Arabian Sea.

Kirthar National Park is one of the major wildlife reserves in Sindh, Pakistan. The Kirthar Range forms the boundary between the Lower Indus Plain (east) and southern Balochistan (west). It is a series of parallel rock hill ridges rising from 4,000 feet (1,200 m) in the south to nearly 8,000 feet (2,500 m) in the north.
