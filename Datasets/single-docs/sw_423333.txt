Division of Grayndler

The Division of Grayndler is an Australian Electoral Division in Sydney, New South Wales. It is one of Australia's smallest electorates, and includes the suburbs of Annandale, Ashfield, Dulwich Hill, Enmore, Haberfield, Hurlstone Park, Leichhardt, Marrickville, Newtown, Petersham, Stanmore and Summer Hill. It was set up in 1949 and is named for Edward Grayndler (1867–1943), a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council and General Secretary of the Australian Workers' Union from 1912 to 1941. 

Fred Daly was a minister in the Whitlam government. Leo McLeay was Speaker of the House 1989–93. He moved to Watson during an electoral boundary change. Tony Whitlam, Gough's son, served only one term but then lost preselection after division boundaries were changed in 1977. 


There was a by-election in Grayndler in 1979 after the death of the sitting member, Frank Stewart.
