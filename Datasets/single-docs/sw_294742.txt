Tax resistance

Tax resistance is when people do not pay a tax because they are angry at how the government uses the money.

Some people are "tax resisters" because they feel bad about helping the government do bad things (like war). Some people are tax resisters to protest. Some people are tax resisters to try to cause a government to fall (like Mohandas Gandhi did in India).
