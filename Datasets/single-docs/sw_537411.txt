Louis Alexandre, Prince of Lamballe

Louis Alexandre de Bourbon (Louis Alexandre Joseph Stanislas; 6 September 1747 – 6 May 1768) was the son and heir of Louis Jean Marie de Bourbon, grandson of Louis XIV by the king's legitimised son, Louis Alexandre de Bourbon, Count of Toulouse. He was known as the "Prince of Lamballe" from birth. He died before his father, and did not have children. 

"Louis Alexandre" was born on 6 September 1747, at the "Hôtel de Toulouse" in Paris. The prince de Lamballe, as he was known all his life, was the couple's only surviving son. He was one of seven children.

His father chose his bride, the Italian born Princess "Maria Luisa" Teresa of Savoy ""Mademoiselle de Carignan"". The wedding celebration lasted from 17 January 1767, until 27 January with feasts in Turin and Nangis. Prior to the wedding, His father had arranged the marriage to try and get his son to settle down as he was a well known womaniser. However after three months of happiness, Louis Alexandre soon tired of his young wife and resumed his life of "débaucherie". He eloped with "Mademoiselle de La Chassaigne", an opera dancer, five months into his marriage. At one point, Louis Alexandre even sold his wife's diamonds to raise money to pay his debts.

After a dissipated short life, Louis Alexandre died on 6 May 1768, sixteen months after his marriage, of a venereal disease at the Château de Louveciennes in the arms of his wife. He died without any children. His wife inherited part of his considerable fortune. He was eventually buried at the Royal Chapel, Dreux, France by his younger sister Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon.
