Ashleigh McIvor

Ashleigh McIvor (born September 15, 1983 in Vancouver, British Columbia) is a Canadian retired freestyle skier. She skied in the women's ski cross event for Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. She became the first gold medal winner of the event. She has also competed at the Winter X Games where she was able to place second. She suffered a devastating ACL injury in her knee which ended her season and was a factor in her retirement from competitive skiing in the fall of 2012. She announced "I’ve gone back and forth in my mind, wondering if I’m making the right decision to retire. But I’ve already done more in the sport than I ever imagined would be possible and there’s something to be said for going out on top, as the reigning Olympic champion."
