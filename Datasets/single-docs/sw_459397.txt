Rod de'Ath

Roderick Morris Buckenham "Rod" de'Ath (18 June 1950 – 1 August 2014) was a Welsh rock musician and record producer. He was best known for being his work with Irish guitarist Rory Gallagher in the 1970s. He was Gallagher's drummer from 1972 until 29 April 1978. During this time, Northern Irish musician Lou Martin was Gallagher's keyboardist. He was also a member of the North London-based rock band Killing Floor, founded in 1968.

Rod de'Ath was born in Saundersfoot, Pembrokeshire. In 1987, he was injured badly in a train accident that caused him to lose an eye and have brain damage, putting him into a coma. After this, de'Ath was stated to be dead in many obituaries. However, he made an appearance a few months after Rory Gallagher's death to prove he was alive.

Rod de'Ath died after a long illness on 1 August 2014 in London, England, aged 64.
