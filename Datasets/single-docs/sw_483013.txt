Minnie Miñoso

Minnie Miñoso (Saturnino Orestes Armas "Minnie" Miñoso Arrieta, ; , November 29, 1922 – March 1, 2015), nicknamed "The Cuban Comet" and "Mr. White Sox", was a Cuban-American professional baseball player. 

He began his career in the Negro league in 1946, becoming an All-Star third baseman with the New York Cubans in 1947 and 1948. He was signed by the Cleveland Indians after the 1948 season as baseball's color line slowly fell. 

In 1949, he became the first black Cuban in the major leagues, and went on to become a seven-time All-Star. In 1951, as a rookie left fielder for the Chicago White Sox, he became the first black player in White Sox franchise history, and one of the first Latin Americans to be named to a major league All-Star team.

Miñoso was found dead in the driver's seat of a car near a gas station in Chicago at 1 am on March 1, 2015, aged 92. He died of a torn pulmonary artery caused by COPD.
