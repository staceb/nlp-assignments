O Death

O Death — also known as O, Death, Oh Death, and Conversations with Death — is a traditional American folk song.

Country blues banjo player Moran Lee "Dock" Boggs (1898-1971) recorded the song in the late 1920s. A recording from the 1938 National Folk Festival held in Washington, D.C. is on file with the Library of Congress. Various folk music artists included "Oh, Death" on a variety of musical collections throughout the 1970s and '80s.
