Connemara

Connemara () is a district in the west of the Republic of Ireland. The Owenglin River flows into the sea at An Clochán/Clifden. At first, Connemara was divided into North and South Connemara. The mountains of the Twelve Bens and the Owenglin River were the natural boundaries between the two parts.

Actor Peter O'Toole was born here in 1932.
