The Black Unicorn

The Black Unicorn is a fantasy book written by Terry Brooks. It is the second book in the "Magic Kingdom of Landover" series. The book continues the stories of Ben Holiday, Willow, and Questor Thews. Each of them had a dream about something important to them. They each left Sterling Silver (the castle they live in) to look for what they dreamed about. The dreams led Ben Holiday to Chicago, Questor Thews to find the books of magic, and Willow to hunt for the black unicorn.
