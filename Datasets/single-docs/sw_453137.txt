Egg donation

Egg donation is when a woman gives some of her eggs (ova). Sometimes it is done to help that woman or another woman have a baby. Sometimes it is for research. Sometimes the eggs are frozen for later.

The first child born from egg donation was in 1983 in Australia. The first one in the United States was born February 3, 1984.

A woman who gives her ova is called an egg donor. Egg donors are recruited, screened, and give consent before participating in the process.
