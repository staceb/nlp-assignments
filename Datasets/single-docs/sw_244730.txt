The Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation ('SIUT') is a largest dialysis & kidney transplant centre in Pakistan.

All services including dialysis and transplantation are provided free of charge.

The Institute started as a department of urology at the government-run Civil Hospital, Karachi in 1970 and received autonomy in 1991.

They perform 10-12 transplants every week, and in 2003 performed Pakistan's first liver transplant. In 2004, a unit for child was opened.
