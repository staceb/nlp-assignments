KeyBank Center

The KeyBank Center is a sports arena in Buffalo, New York. The arena opened on September 21, 1996, and is the current home to the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) and the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League (NLL).

The arena was originally known as Marine Midland Arena from 1996 to 1999 and as HSBC Arena from 2000 to 2011. First Niagara Bank acquired the naming rights for the arena in 2011. The arena name next changed after KeyBank bought First Niagara Bank in 2016. Outside signs began to show the new name in August of that year, with the name change to "KeyBank Center" becoming official on September 19.

KeyBank Center has held many WWE events as well including: The Great American Bash in 2005, Armageddon in 2008, Night of Champions in 2011, and WWE Battleground in 2013.
