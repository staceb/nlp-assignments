Manta ray

The manta ray ("Manta birostris") is the largest species of the rays. The largest known specimen was more than across, with a weight of about . It ranges throughout tropical waters of the world, typically around coral reefs. They have the largest brain-to-body ratio of the sharks, rays and skates (Elasmobranchii), a brain which is kept warm during lengthy dives to as deep as in cold water.

Mantas may be at least two different species, the giant manta ("Manta birostris"), which migrates, and another smaller one called the reef manta ("Manta alfredi"), which does not. The genus may need revising.

Manta rays are probably at the top of the food chain. Some shark species, such as the tiger shark may hunt them.
