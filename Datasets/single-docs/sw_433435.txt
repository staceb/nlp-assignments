Puebloan peoples

The Pueblo people are a group of Native American people who live in the southwestern part of the United States. They speak several different native languages. They are split into two major cultures, based on different systems of kinship. When the Spanish arrived in the 16th century, they were living in communities that the Spanish called pueblos, meaning "towns". Today there are 21 pueblos remaining. The main pueblos are located in the states of New Mexico and Arizona.
