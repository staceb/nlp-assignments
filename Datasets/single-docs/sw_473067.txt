Billy Boys

"Billy Boys", also titled "The Billy Boys, is a loyalist song from Glasgow, sung to the tune of "Marching Through Georgia." It was first sung in the 1930s as the main song of one of the Glasgow razor gangs led by Billy Fullerton and later became viewed to reflect the long running sectarian divide in the city. It is also commonly used by fans of Rangers football club.
