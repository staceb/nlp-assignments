Lomonosov, Russia

Lomonosov is a town in Russia near St Petersburg. It used to be called Oranienbaum. This was a German name which means "Orange tree". It used to have greenhouses where plants from faraway countries were grown. Oranienbaum was famous for making coloured glass.

In 1948 the town changed its name to the Russian name Lomonosov.

The old palace, which dates from the early 18th century, still stands. Unlike the other famous palaces around St Petersburg, this one was not captured by the Germans during the Second World War.
