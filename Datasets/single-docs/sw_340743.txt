Chinese Crested Dog

The Chinese crested dog is a hairless dog breed. The breed probably did not actually come from China. It is the most common hairless dog breed. However, some of them do have fur. Other hairless dog breeds are the American Hairless Terrier, Mexican Hairless Dog, Peruvian Hairless Dog, and Hairless Khala. Hairless Chinese cresteds often win the World's Ugliest Dog Contest, which takes place every year in Petaluma, California.

The Chinese crested is a friendly, intelligent animal.
