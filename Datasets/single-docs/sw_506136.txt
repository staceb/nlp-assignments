Extragalactic astronomy

Extragalactic astronomy is astronomy about objects outside our Milky Way galaxy. It is the study of everything that is not covered in galactic astronomy: the study of objects in our galaxy.

Because of improvements in technology, we can see distant objects in more detail. Two versions of extragalactic astronomy are: near-extragalactic astronomy (the study of galaxies in our Local Group) and far-extragalactic astronomy (the study of objects outside our Local Group).
