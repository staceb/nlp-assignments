Machete

A machete is a long cutting tool. The blade is usually 20-24 inches (50-60 cm) long and less than .2 inches thick. The machete is a large knife often used in jungles because it can easily cut through plants and vines. It can be used to open coconuts and cut down small trees (sometimes the back side has edges for sawing wood). It is also used occasionally outside of jungles. One such use is in surveying when a line of sight is needed through brush. It is a lot like the Japanese katana and larger than the American Bowie knife, and is sometimes used in warfare.
