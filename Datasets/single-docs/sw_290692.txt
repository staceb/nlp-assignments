Moeritherium

Moeritherium is a extinct genus of primitive mammals. It represent a very early stage in the evolution of elephants. These prehistoric mammals are related to the elephant and, more distantly, the sea cow. They lived during the later Eocene in what is now North Africa.

"Moeritherium" did not resemble living elephants. It was about as large as a tapir. It had short, strong legs, a relatively long body, and a short tail. The feet of "Moeritherium" were broad and had flat-hoofed toes.
