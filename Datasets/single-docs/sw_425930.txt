Kika

Kika is a 1994 comedy movie. The title character gets involved in relationships with different men and is assaulted several times. One of these assaults is by a pornographic movie actor with a very low IQ. He assaults Kika with serious force and is then pulled from her by two unknown people.

The movie originally received an NC-17 just before its release in the United States half a year after completion. The rating, though, was surrendered, and "Kika" was then released unrated.
