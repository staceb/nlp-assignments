Selena Etc.

Selena Etc. is American singer Selena's clothing store chain. She began designing and manufacturing in 1993 and opened two boutiques. The two stores were in Corpus Christi and the other in San Antonio. Both had beauty salons. "Hispanic Business" reported that the singer earned over $5,000,000 dollars from these boutiques. One was going to open in Monterrey, Mexico in 1995 but did not because of her death. In 2009, Chris Perez, widower of Selena, had to close the stores due to the recession of 2007.
