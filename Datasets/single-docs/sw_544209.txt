David Tod Roy

David Tod Roy (; 1933 – May 31, 2016) was an American professor and scholar of Chinese literature. He taught at University of Chicago from 1967 until he took early retirement in 2006. 

He was known for his translation of Jin Ping Mei, or "The Plum in the Golden Vase", one of the Four Great Novels of the Ming dynasty. It was the first complete translation into a Western language. 

He was diagnosed with ALS (often known as Lou Gehrig's disease) just as he had finished the translation in 2012 and died of that disease in 2016.
