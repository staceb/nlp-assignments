Music! Music! Music!

"Music! Music! Music!" is a popular song. The best known version was by Teresa Brewer, recorded in 1949. The song became became #1 and a million seller in 1950. Some radio stations would not play the song because of the lyric "I'd do anything for you/Anything you want me to". That lyric was often thought to be indecent.

One version of the song was done by Petula Clark, also around 1950.

Brewer made several versions of the song. The one for the Coral label had a stronger beat and orchestra arrangement.
