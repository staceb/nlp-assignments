Ms. G.O.A.T.

Ms. G.O.A.T., is the first mixtape by American rapper Lil' Kim. It was released June 3, 2008 independently by Kim's own record label Queen Bee Entertainment. Lil Kim had never made a mix tape before, and in an MTV interview, she stated "I always wanted to do a mixtape... I used to see how 50 (Cent) used to do it so hard... Damn, it’s not a lot of girls doing it.". "Ms. G.O.A.T." was her first own published release. The album features some new songs as well as remixes of several songs like Britney Spears' "Gimme More" and Alicia Keys' "No One".
