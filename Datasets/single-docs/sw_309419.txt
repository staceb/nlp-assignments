Ireland's Call

Ireland's Call is the anthem for the Ireland national rugby union team. The anthem replaced "Amhrán na bhFiann" because the players had came from both Ireland and Northern Ireland.

In most games today, the first part has been sung, then the chorus two times.

Part 1

Come the day and come the hour

Come the power and the glory

We have come to answer our country's call

From the four proud provinces of Ireland

Chorus

Ireland, Ireland

Together standing tall

Shoulder to shoulder

We'll answer Ireland's call

Part 2

From the mighty glens of Antrim

From the rugged hills of Galway

From the walls of Limerick and Dublin Bay

From the four proud provinces of Ireland

Part 3

Hearts of steel and heads unbowing

Vowing never to be broken

We will fight until we can fight no more

For the four proud provinces of Ireland

Part 4

Erin's warriors, clad in emerald

Steadfast souls confront their challenge

'Neath the glass sky they assemble

For the four proud provinces of Ireland
