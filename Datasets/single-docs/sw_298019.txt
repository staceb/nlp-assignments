In its current form, the city was created in 1974 by joining the following 18 municipalities:

Königslutter proper is on the Lutter stream and developed from the village of Lutter which was first mentioned in 1150. It became a market town around 1300, then a city around 1400. In early modern times, beer brewing and Elm limestone mining and cutting have been its main industries. Tourism is also important, because of the German Half-Timbered House Road and the Dom - the monastery church built by Emperor Lothar II.

In 1924, the village of Oberlutter and the monastery church of Königslutter were incorporated as a city. The Benedictine monastery was founded near the village of Lutter in 1135 by Holy Roman Emperor Lothar II. The monastery church is known for its sculptural art and the tomb of the emperor.

Königslutter is also the site for a large psychiatric hospital. The hospital, run by AWO can treat over 500 people plus outpatients and day-care therapy in the clinics in Wolfsburg and Peine
