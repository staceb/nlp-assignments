Crime of passion

The term crime of passion refers to a criminal act in which the perpetrator commits a crime against someone else due to strong impulse (for example, grief or heartbreak) rather than in the premeditated fashion. For example, the wife may take her revenge on a person with whom a husband may have had an affair, or vice versa. This is known by the term "temporary insanity" in the United States.
