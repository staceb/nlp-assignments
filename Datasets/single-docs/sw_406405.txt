Women's magazine

A women's magazine is a magazine that is mostly for women. These magazines were started because big newsapers sometimes had parts that were for women. Sometimes tabloid journalism is also for women. Unlike tabloids, which are published daily, women's magazines are usually published weekly or monthly.
