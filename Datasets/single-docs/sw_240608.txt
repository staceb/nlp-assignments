Chicoutimi

Chicoutimi is a city in Quebec, Canada. The name comes from Shkoutimeou, which means "the end of the deep water" in the Montagnais language, one of the Algonquian languages. Located 225 kilometres north of Quebec City, it is home to part of the Université du Québec. Until 2002 it was a separate city, and is now a part of Saguenay

The first people to live in the city were French fur traders who arrived in 1676. It became a city in 1842 by Peter McLeod. A railway was built between the city and Roberval in 1893, which helped make Chicoutimi a bigger city at the end of the 19th century, based on industry and pulp.

The Chicoutimi Saguenéens, a team in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, have been in the city since 1973. They play at the Centre Georges-Vézina.
