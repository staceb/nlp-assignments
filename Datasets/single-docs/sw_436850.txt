Speed badminton

Speed Badminton (or "Speedminton") is a form of badminton played without a net. It is faster than ordinary badminton. It combines rules from different sports like badminton, squash and tennis. Today, Speedminton is played all around the world. There are about 3,000 registered players that compete internationally and about 2 million players around the world.

There is no net in between players. There is also no firm rules about where it is played. It can be played on tennis courts, streets, beaches, fields or gyms. The court is two squares of 5.50–metre (18 ft) length. They are fixed opposite to each other at a distance of 12.8 m (42 ft).

There are tournaments all over the world. Tournaments are organized into a growing number of clubs. In some countries, associations are already established, for example the German Speed Badminton Association (DSBV) and the Swiss Speed Badminton (SSB). On August 25, 2011 the international Speed Badminton Organization (ISBO) was founded in Berlin.
