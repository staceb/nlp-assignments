Morrisons

Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc (Morrisons) () is the fourth biggest supermarket in the United Kingdom. Its main offices are in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England. The company is usually called Morrisons. In 2008, Sir Ken Morrison left the company.
Dalton Philips is the current head. The old CEO was Marc Bolland, who left to become CEO of Marks & Spencer.

As of September 2009, Morrisons has 455 shops in the United Kingdom. 

On 15 March 2007, Morrisons said that it would stop its old branding and go for a more modern brand image. Their lower price brand, "Bettabuy", was also changed to a more modern brand called the "Morrisons Value".. This brand was then changed again in 2012 as Morrisons started their low price option brand called "M Savers".

In 2005 Morrisons bought part of the old Rathbones Bakeries for £15.5 million which make Rathbones and Morrisons bread.

In 2011, Morrisons opened a new 767,500 square/foot centre in Bridgwater for a £11 million redevelopment project. This project also made 200 new jobs.
