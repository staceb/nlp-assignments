Veterinary medicine

Veterinary medicine is a branch of medicine that deals with the health of animals. It is the study and practice of preventing, diagnosing and treating disease and injuries in animals. Veterinary medicine covers all species of animals, including both domesticated animals and wild animals.

People who study and practice veterinary medicine professionally are called veterinarians (often known as "vets").

Veterinary science tries to help human health by monitoring and controlling zoonotic diseases (infectious diseases transmitted from animals to humans).
