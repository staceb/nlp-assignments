Nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system

The nociceptive trigeminal inhibition tension suppression system (NTI-TSS or NTI-split) is a small splint placed in the front part of the mouth on the upper or lower front teeth in order to protect teeth. It reduces wear on the teeth caused by someone clenching and grinding their teeth. By reducing this, it is claimed to prevent headaches.
