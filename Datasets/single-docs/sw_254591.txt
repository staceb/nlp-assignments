Pedro Martinez

Pedro Jaime Abreu Martínez, known as Pedro Martínez (born October 25, 1971), is a Dominican pitcher who played for five Major League Baseball teams from 1992 to 2008—the Los Angeles Dodgers, Montreal Expos, Boston Red Sox, New York Mets, and Philadelphia Phillies. Martínez is one of 18 pitchers in MLB history with 3,000 career strikeouts, was named to eight All-Star Game rosters, won the Cy Young Award as the top pitcher in the National League once and the American League twice, and helped the Red Sox to a World Series victory in 2004, the team's first since 1918. Martínez was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2015, the first year in which he could be elected.

He is also notable for having pushed aside New York Yankees bench coach Don Zimmer during a baseball brawl.
