Orange Walk Town

Orange Walk Town is the second largest town in the nation of Belize. It has a population of about 13,400. It is the capital of the Orange Walk District. Orange Walk Town is on the left bank of the New River. It is 53 miles north of Belize City and 30 miles (50 km) south of Corozal Town.

In the days of the Mayas, the area was known as Holpatin.

Orange Walk Town is nicknamed "Sugar City". The local Tower Hill Sugar Factory (Belize Sugar Industries) handles all of the country's sugar cane output. The farming of other crops, and tourism, also play a role in the economy.

The region is highly populated by Mestizos, Kriols, Mennonites, Chinese, Taiwanese, Indians, and other people from Central America.
