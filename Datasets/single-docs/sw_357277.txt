Old World warbler

The "Old World Warblers" is the name used to describe a large group of birds that used to be in the bird family Sylviidae. The family held over 400 species in over 70 genera, and was the source of much taxonomic confusion. Two families were separated later, the Cisticolidae and the Regulidae. In the past ten years they have been researched and many species are now put into other families. These families include the Acrocephalidae, Cettiidae, Phylloscopidae, and Megaluridae.

Most Old World Warblers are of generally unseparate appearances. The sexes are often identical. However, some may be different, especially in the genus "Sylvia". They are of small to medium size, from 9 to 16 centimeters in length. Their bills are small and pointed. Almost all species are mostly insectivorous. However, some will also eat fruit, nectar, or small seeds.

Most of the species are monogamous and build simple, cup-shaped nests in plants. They lay between two and six eggs each time, depending on species. Both parents help in raising the young, which are able to fly at around two weeks of age.
