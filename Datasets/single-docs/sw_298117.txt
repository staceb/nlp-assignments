Mary Jane Bennett

Mary Jane Bennett (1816 to 6 July 1885) was the first official lighthouse keeper in New Zealand, and the only woman to have the position.

Mary moved to New Zealand in 1840. She soon married George White Bennett. In 1852 George took the position of lighthouse keeper at Pencarrow Head. Following the death of her husband in 1855, Mary worked at the lighthouse. In January 1859 a good lighthouse building was made. She was selected as keeper. Pencarrow Lighthouse was the first permanent lighthouse in New Zealand.
