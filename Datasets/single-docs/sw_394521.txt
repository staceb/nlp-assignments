Araneomorphae

The Araneomorphae are the kinds of spiders that humans most often see around their homes and gardens. They are different from the Mygalomorphae, the group of spiders that includes the tarantulas (also called "bird-eating spider"). There is a third group of spiders that is extremely ancient and now has few species remaining. It is called the "Mesothelae".
