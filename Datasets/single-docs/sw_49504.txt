Versailles

Versailles is a French city. It is in the western suburbs of Paris, 17.1 km. (10.6 miles) from the center of Paris. It is the "capital" of the Yvelines département. This city is very important for the History of France because it was formerly the capital of the kingdom of France.

Its name comes from the Latin word "vertere", meaning to turn the soil. It is twelve miles west from Paris.

Versailles is made world-famous by the Palace of Versailles (Château de Versailles), where Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI lived.

In 2004, about 85,900 people lived here.

It is also famous because this is where the Treaty of Versailles was signed at the end of The Great War.
