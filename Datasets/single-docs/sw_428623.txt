WWE Raw 2

WWE Raw 2 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Anchor Inc. and published by THQ. The game was released on the Xbox.

It was released on September 15, 2003 in North America and on October 10, 2003 in the PAL region. The game was the sequel to WWE Raw which was released in 2002.

IGN rated the game a 9.1 out of 10 and said "The new moves you get with the cage, cell, tables, ladders and chairs does take things a step beyond what the all-powerful No Mercy showed us. The gameplay and create-a-wrestler elements of the game are outstanding and make Raw 2 worth the price of admission for wrestling fans.”

GameSpot gave the game a 6.9 out of 10 and stated "WWE Raw 2 just doesn't feel like much of a step forward in the series. Instead it feels more like a big step sideways."
