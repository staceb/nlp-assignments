Testimonial

A testimonial is when a company uses a celebrity or famous person or a member of the public to endorse a product so the consumer wants it too. For example a professional football player recommends a particular brand of shirts. The idea behind this is for the consumer to think "Oh! That famous person likes that shirt, I think I'll get it too!".
