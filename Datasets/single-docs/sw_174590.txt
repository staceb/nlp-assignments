Polytope

A polytope is figure in geometry. It is a geometric object with flat sides, in any number of dimensions. A polygon is a polytope in two dimensions, a polyhedron in three dimensions, and so on. Sometimes the number of dimensions is shown as a number, as in a polyhedron being a 3-polytope or a tesseract a convex regular 4-polytope.
