Leviathan

Leviathan (, "twisted, coiled"), is a monster mentioned in the Bible. In Satanism Leviathan is believed to be one of the princes of Hell. The word has become synonymous with any large sea monster or creature. In classical literature (such as the novel "Moby-Dick") it refers to great whales, and in Modern Hebrew, it means simply "whale."
