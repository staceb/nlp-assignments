Estelle Balet

Estelle Balet (19 December 1994 – 19 April 2016) was a Swiss freeride snowboarder and two-time world champion in 2015 and 2016 at the Freeride World Tour. 

Balet started skiing early in her childhood. At the age of ten she transitioned from skiing to snowboarding. Balet specialized particularly in switch, frontside 180, frontside 360 and jib. In 2015, Balet became the youngest ever Freeride World Tour champion when she won the women's snowboarding event. She won the same event in 2016.

On 19 April 2016, Balet died in an avalanche while snowboarding in Orsières. She was filming a snowboard segment for a film called "Exploring the Known" on Le Portalet in southwestern Switzerland. Despite swift action from emergency services and attendance from Air Glaciers, she died from her injuries.
