Pasophae

Pasophae, also spelt Pasiphaë, is a character in Greek mythology. She is the daughter of the sun god, Helios and the wife of King Minos. She was the mother of many of Minos' children. They included Ariadne and her brother Androgeos, who was killed by the Athenians. She also had an affair with a prized bull her husband had refused to sacrifice to Poseidon. The offspring of Pasophae and the bull was the Minotaur, which was eventually killed by Theseus.
