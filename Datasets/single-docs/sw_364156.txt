Salicornia

Salicornia is a genus of plants which grow in salty envionments. They are pioneer plants that grow on beaches in the sand, and on salt marshes. They are the only plants in the marshes that cannot survive without salt. The plants are edible. Geese spending the winter on a coast also feed on these plants. The ash of the plant was used to make Sodium carbonate.
