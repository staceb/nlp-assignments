Telephone numbers in Belarus

Country Code: +375<br>
International Call Prefix: 00 (was 8~10)<br>
Trunk Prefix: 8

Belarus began using its own country code +375 in 1995. Before that it was part of the +7 international country code. The local numbering plan came from USSR. It has changed little.

Geographic area codes were made based on previous 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead "0". Calling across areas still requires dialing trunk prefix 8 and waiting for dialtone after that.
