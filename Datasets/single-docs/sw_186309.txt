Teddy boy

A Teddy boy was a young man who dressed in a style popular in 1950s Britain. The word 'Teddy' comes from the clothes, which were a version of clothes from the Edwardian period, about 1910. That period is named after Edward VII (19011910).

Teddy boys relate to early rock and roll music. People often thought of them as rebels. The teddy boy also meant the first British culture of young people. For the first time, teenagers who were in a working class could buy clothes, a bicycle or motorcycle and entertainment. Teddyboys wore clothes that might shock older people. 

The style featured a long and jacket with one row of buttons and narrow pants, "brothel creeper" shoes with thick crepe soles and pencil-thin ties. Duck-tail hairstyles were the norm. The movement was working class, and rather dandyfied. It was quite short-lived, and gave way to the mods and rockers of the early 1960s.
