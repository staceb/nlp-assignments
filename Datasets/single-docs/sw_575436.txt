Joseph Tydings

Joseph Davies Tydings (born May 4, 1928) is a former Democratic member of the United States Senate, representing the state of Maryland from 1965 to 1971.

Tydings was born in Asheville, North Carolina. Tydings moved to Maryland after he was adopted by Millard Tydings, U.S. Senator from Maryland. After serving in the military, he got his law degree at the University of Maryland and entered into practice. 

He served in the Maryland House of Delegates from 1955 to 1961, and as United States Attorney from 1961 until his resignation in 1963 to run for Senate.

Tydings won election to the Senate in 1964. However, his controversial stances on gun control and crime in the District of Columbia cost him re-election in 1970. He made another attempt at his old seat in 1976, but was defeated in the Democratic primary election by Paul Sarbanes. 

He later served as a member of the Board of Regents of the University of Maryland, College Park and the University System of Maryland, and continues to practice law.
