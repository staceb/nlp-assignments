Cape Romano

Cape Romano is a cape at the southern end of Caxambas Island, just south of Marco Island and northwest of the Ten Thousand Islands in Collier County, Florida. Cape Romano was also the spot where Hurricane Wilma made its first U.S. landfall in October 2005.

Calusa Indians declared-ownership of the area and called it Manataca. Juan Ponce de León made a short stop at Manataca on his first visit from Puerto Rico to Florida, but the Indians tried to fight him off.

Cape Romano was the spot where Hurricane Wilma first reached land in the U.S. October 2005. Tropical Storm Fay also reached land here in 2008.
