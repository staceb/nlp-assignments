Danegeld

The Danegeld ("Danish tax") was a tax that the English kingdoms paid to the Vikings between the 9th and 11th centuries. The Vikings called it “geld” or “gafol” in the 11th century, but the term Danegeld did not appear until the early 12th century.

Besides the taxes in England, the term also applies to Eastern Europe in the 9th century, where Sami, Finnish, and Slavic tribes paid taxes to the Swedes. In Francia (France), the Franks paid off the Vikings in Normandy (Normans), and in return, the Normans would convert to Christianity and cease to raid.
