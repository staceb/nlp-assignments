Dark web

The dark web is the world wide web content that exists on darknets. These are overlay networks which use the public internet but need specific software, configurations or authorization to access. The dark web is a small part of the deep web. The deep web is the part of the web not accessed by search engines. Sometimes the term "deep web" is wrongly used to refer to the dark web only.

The dark web includes small, friend-to-friend peer-to-peer networks, as well as large networks like Freenet, I2P, and Tor. Users of the dark web refer to the regular web as the clearnet because it is not encrypted. The Tor dark web may be referred to as onionland,
