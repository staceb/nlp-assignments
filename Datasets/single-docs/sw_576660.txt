Destroyer

A destroyer is a fast, small, and maneuverable warship. Destroyers escort larger warships. Destroyers were first used in the late 1800s to defend against torpedo boats. Destroyers were used extensively during World War I and World War II. Today, most naval warships are destroyers. Only three nations use cruisers. Modern destroyers use cruise missiles, automated turrets, and torpedos. Some can launch nuclear missiles. Modern destroyers usually support carrier groups and amphibious landings.
