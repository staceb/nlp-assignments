Maria Radner

Maria Friderike Radner (7 May 1981 – 24 March 2015) was a German contralto and internationally renowned opera singer. After studying at the Robert Schumann Hochschule in Düsseldorf, she appeared internationally in opera and concert. In January 2013, she played the Schwertleite in "Die Walküre" at the Teatro Comunale Florence, Italy under Zubin Mehta, and in March the Erda at the Grand Théâtre de Genève, conducted by Ingo Metzmacher. Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 2012 in "Götterdämmerung" was part of the documentation of the production in the film "Wagner's Dream".

Radner died on 24 March 2015 along with her husband Sascha Schenk and their infant son Felix, and colleague Oleg Bryjak, in the Germanwings Flight 9525 crash, which occurred near Prads-Haute-Bléone, Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, France. She and Bryjak were returning from performances of Richard Wagner's "Siegfried" at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona.
