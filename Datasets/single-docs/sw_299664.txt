Adelaide River

The Adelaide River is in the Northern Territory of Australia. It starts in the Lichfield National Park and flows into the sea at Clarence Strait, about 50 km northeast of Darwin. The river is about 253 km in length. It is well known for its Saltwater Crocodiles.

Europeans first explored the river in 1839 when a British sailor, Ben Helpmann, explored it by boat.
