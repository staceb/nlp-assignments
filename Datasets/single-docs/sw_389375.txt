Poás Volcano National Park

Poás Volcano National Park, in Spanish , is a National Park in Costa Rica. The volcano is located in the province of Alajuela. The main crater is deep and is active. There are frequent small geyser and lava eruptions. The last major eruptions were during 1952-54.

The park is frequently closed because of sulphur gas. Over the last decade there have been indications that the volcano is slowly building up for a new eruption.
