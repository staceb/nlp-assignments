Bush rat

The bush rat ("Rattus fuscipes") is a small Australian nocturnal animal. It is an omnivore. It is one of the most common species of rats.

The bush rat is found most in the coastal regions of southwestern Australia. It is mostly in the lowlands, but the bush rat can also be found in parts of the Australian Alps and on some offshore islands.

It is a pest species because it can destroy cane fields. It is also host to more parasites than any other Australian rodent.
