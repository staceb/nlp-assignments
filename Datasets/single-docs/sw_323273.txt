Barwon Heads Airport is a small airfield used only for light aircraft on the Bellarine Peninsula near the township of Barwon Heads, Victoria, Australia. It is mainly used for scenic tourist flights, private aircraft and flight training.

The airport is small and undeveloped. In 2008 five new hangars and new carparking was built.

The airport has a flight training school with two classrooms, fuel facilities and a seafood shop. There are showers and toilets in the terminal building. other facilities include a kitchen, snack and drink machines, and a lounge area.

The airport has two runways, the main one is a gravel north/south runway. There is a smaller east/west grass runway, mainly used by ultralight aircraft, and light aircraft in stronger wind conditions.

The owners of Barwon Heads Airport have tried to stop skydiving near the airport. They think the airport runway is too close to the proposed drop zones. In 2005, a ban was placed on skydiving near the airport. In 2008, airport owners said the company Skydive City was using an illegal runway 200 metres from the airport. Skydive City had been forced out of an airport hangar for not paying rent. Airport owners said the illegal runway was dangerous for airport users.
