Vermouth

Vermouth is a sweet wine, that has been converted to a spirit. It usually has between 15 and 18 percent of alcohol. Also, certain herbs are added to flavour the wine. Its name is derived from a plant called Artemisia absinthium, which makes it taste slightly bitter. It is often used for cocktails. In its current form, Vermouth was first made in Turin, in 1757. In the 19th century, it was also produced in France. Vermouth is sometimes used as a substitute for white wine in cooking. 

Vermouth is not the same as the spirit called Absinthe. Absinthe is also based on Artemisia absinthium, but it has 45-50 percent alcohol per volume.
