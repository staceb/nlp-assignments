Ischigualasto Provincial Park

Ischigualasto Provincial Park is a protected area in San Juan Province, north-western Argentina. The park is also called Valle de la Luna ("Valley of the Moon") due to its otherworldly appearance.

It contains the geological formation called the "Ischigualasto Formation". The formation is also included in the Talampaya National Park in the La Rioja Province. The Ischigualasto Formation has fossils from the Triassic period. These are some of the oldest known dinosaur remains.

In 2000 UNESCO included Ischigualasto in its World Heritage Sites.
