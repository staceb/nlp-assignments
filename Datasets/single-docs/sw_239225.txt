Peshitta

The Peshitta (Classical Syriac for "simple, common, straight, vulgate") is the standard version of the Syriac Bible.

The Old Testament of the Peshitta was translated from the Hebrew, probably in the 2nd century. The New Testament of the Peshitta, which originally excluded certain disputed books (2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, Jude, Revelation), had become the standard by the early 5th century.
