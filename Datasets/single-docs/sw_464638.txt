Bhaati Gate

The Bhaati Gate is one of the 12 old gates of Lahore's walled city, now in Pakistan. It dates from Mughal times. 

The Bhaati Gate was named after the Bhatti tribe of Rajputs who used to live here in large numbers. It also has an old bazaar, or market called "Bazaar i Hakiman" (Bazaar of the Doctors) where traditional doctors or medical experts, used to help sick people. Another famous place here is the Fakir Khana Museum, made by the Fakir Family.

For a long time, the Bhaati Gate area was also the 'literary home' to many famous writers, living here. These included Maulana Muhammad Hussain Azad (a student of Mirza Ghalib), Pakistan's national poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Hakim Ahmad Shuja, Syed Imtiaz Ali Taj, Agha Hashr and others.

Bhaati area also has many other old buildings and shops etc., that are of interest to tourists.
