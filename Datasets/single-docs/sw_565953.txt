Water Under the Bridge

"Water Under the Bridge" is a song by English singer-songwriter Adele. It is the sixth song on her third studio album, "25". It was written by Adele and her frequent writing partner, Greg Kurstin, who also produced the song. "Water Under the Bridge" was released as the fourth single from "25" on November 4, 2016.

The song is a more upbeat song, similar to "Rolling in the Deep". So far, it has charted at number 26 on the US "Billboard" Hot 100. It was certified gold by the RIAA in 2017 for shipments of 500,000 copies in the US.

When reviewing "25", Lewis Corner from "Digital Spy" wrote that Adele and Kurstin "strike upon a shimmering mid-tempo pop parade, as the London singer proclaims 'if you're going to let me down, let me down gently' over the chewiest melody she's laid her vocals on. […] Adele's perceptive lyric and rich vocal makes it entirely her own."
