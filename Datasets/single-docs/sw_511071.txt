Rules for the Direction of the Mind

Rules for the Direction of the Mind () is a book by René Descartes. It was written about 1628. It was not finished, because 36 rules were planned in all, but only 21 were actually written. This work was not published while the author was alive. The "Rules" were published in 1701 in Amsterdam.

Many ideas in this book reappeared, year later, in the "Discourse on the Method".

Although young, Descartes in times of "Regulae" had already believed in innate ideas, for example of the mathematical truths.
