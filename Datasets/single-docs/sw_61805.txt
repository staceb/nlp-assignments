Ptah

Ptah was the ancient Egyptian god of craftsmen and architects. Ptah is named in the Turin King List as the first of the eight legendary god-kings of Egypt.

In art, he is shown as a hairless, bearded mummified man, often wearing a skull cap, holding a djed or other large tool (which he is sometimes shown using during mummification ceremonies). He was believed to be married to Sekhmet.

Ptah was the local god of Memphis, one of the ancient capitals of Egypt. He is the parson of craftsmen, since it is believed that he invented the arts.
