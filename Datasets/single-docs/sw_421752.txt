Donkey Kong Barrel Blast

Donkey Kong Barrel Blast, known as Donkey Kong Jet Race in Europe and Australia and as Donkey Kong Barrel Jet Race in Japan, is a racing video game for the Wii game console. It was released in Japan on June 28, 2007, in North America on October 8, 2007, in Europe on January 25, 2008, and in Australia on February 7, 2008. It was originally going to be released on the Nintendo GameCube and was going to use the DK Bongos, but was moved to the Wii.

"Donkey Kong Barrel Blast" is a racing game where the player controls their character with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk. To move their character, the player has to shake the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, lift them at the same time to jump, and use the controller's motion sensor to beat their opponents and use items. The main mode of play is a Grand Prix like the one seen in the "Mario Kart" series. There is also a Time Trial mode where players can race on one track without opponents.
