Royal Rumble (2000)

The Royal Rumble 2000 was the 22nd Royal Rumble, which Dwayne Johnson (better known as "The Rock") won. At the end of the rumble, The Rock and The Big Show were left. Big Show was about to throw The Rock out, but then Rock reversed the move and threw the Big Show out to win. Big Show proved that The Rock hit the ground first however it could not be arranged again because WrestleMania was in one month, so the Rock remained as the winner. After that, Show hit The Rock because of frustration.
