Hoher Dachstein

Hoher Dachstein is an Austrian mountain. It is the second highest mountain in the Northern Limestone Alps. It is at the border of Upper Austria and Styria in central Austria. It is the highest point in each of those states. Parts of it are also in the state of Salzburg. Because of this it is sometimes called the "Drei-Länder-Berg" ("three-state mountain"). 

The Dachstein has a rich cave system. The Dachstein is famous for its fossils, including megalodonts.
