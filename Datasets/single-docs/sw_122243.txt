Synonym (taxonomy)

Synonyms in taxonomy are similar to normal synonyms, there are two (or more than two) names for the same thing in a scientific classification. For example, the cat has a few scientific names in: "Felis silvestris catus", "Felis catus", and "Felis catus domestica".

In botany, the word "synonym" has a special meaning. There is one "correct name", and the other names are synonyms. For example, "Daemonorops draco" is the correct name of a species of palm trees, and "Calamus draco" is a synonym for the same species.

In zoology, there is one "valid name" and the others are "junior synonyms".
