Basarab I of Wallachia

Basarab I (c. 1310/1319–1352) was an early ruler of the principality of Wallachia from perhaps as early as 1310 until 1352. He is sometimes referred to as "Întemeietorul" ("The Founder"), given his role in the creation of the state, together with his position as common ancestor of rulers in the Basarab dynasty.
