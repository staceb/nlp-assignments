Fume hood

A fume hood or fume cupboard is a large piece of scientific equipment common to chemistry laboratories. Fume hoods stop a person coming into contact with hazardous fumes. They contain an air pump that sucks fumes away from the person using them.

Fume hoods have a large glass window that is opened when a scientist needs to get inside. The window protects the scientist from splashes of chemicals or explosions that could harm them. Most chemical reactions are done inside a fume hood.
