United Church of Canada

The United Church of Canada is the largest Protestant Christian denomination in Canada, and the second largest Canadian Christian denomination after the Roman Catholic Church. It was started in 1925 when four Canadian churches decided to merge: the Methodist Church of Canada, the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec, two-thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, and the Association of Local Union Churches. In 1968, the Canadian branch of the Evangelical United Brethren Church decided to join the United Church of Canada.
