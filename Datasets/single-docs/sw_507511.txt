Góra

Góra is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. The town is approximately north-west of the regional capital Wrocław. The population was 12,574 in 2006.

The settlement was first named "Góra" in an 1155 deed by Pope Adrian IV. It gave the property to a diocese of the Roman Catholic Church. The name of the town means "hill" or "mountain" in the Old Polish language. Beginning in the 14th century, the town became a centre of cloth manufacturing.

Góra became part of the Kingdom of Prussia during a war in 1742. In World War II it was occupied by the Red Army in 1945. In the Potsdam Agreement, the town fell to the Republic of Poland, and the remaining German population was thrown out. The town became a county seat again in 1946.
