House of Romanov

The House of Romanov () was the second and last imperial dynasty to rule over Russia. It ruled from 1613 until the February Revolution took away the crown in 1917. The later history of the Imperial House is sometimes referred to as the House of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov.

The Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, who was from a younger branch of the Oldenburgs, married into the Romanov family in the mid-eighteenth century. Though officially known as the House of Romanov, these descendants of the Romanov and Oldenburg Houses are sometimes referred to as Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov.
