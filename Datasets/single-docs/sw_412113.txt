Véhicule Blindé Léger

The Véhicule Blindé Léger or VBL (light armoured vehicle) is a four-wheel drive reconnaissance light military vehicle. It has been used by the French army since 1990. More than 25 foreign countries used it, including Gabon, Qatar, and Serbia. The US Army used it as M11 for hazardous material reconnaissance. Russia bought 500 of them in November 2012.

The vehicle is designed and built in France by Panhard.
