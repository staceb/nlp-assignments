Next Eleven

The Next Eleven (or N-11) are eleven countries—Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and Vietnam—that Goldman Sachs investment bank says will probably become some of the world's largest economies in the 21st century, together with the BRICS. The bank chose these states on December 12, 2005 because they are good places for people to invest money, and are likely to become a lot richer soon.
