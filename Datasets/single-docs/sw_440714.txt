First inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson

The first inauguration of Lyndon B. Johnson as the 36th President of the United States occurred on November 22, 1963. 

The inauguration was the beginning of the first term of Lyndon B. Johnson. That term lasted a year and two months instead of the usual four years. That was because Johnson was finishing the term of John F. Kennedy, who had been assassinated. This was the only presidential inauguration to be held on Air Force One.
