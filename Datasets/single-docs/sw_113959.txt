Kanfen

Kanfen is a village in France near Thionville. It is in the Lorraine Region, in the moselle department, in north-eastern France. The population as of 2007 is about 996.

The first mention of the village is under the name "Cantevanne", in a 1239 text. Later it became Kaufen. In 1801, it changed to Kanfen. The name stayed the same when Alsace-Moselle became part of the German Empire in 1870.

The most likely etymology is a contraction of the Gaulish word "canto" (mountain) and the Germanic radical "Fenn" (marshland).

Kanfen and all of the Thionville region was dependent of the Duchy of Luxembourg. Le Grand Condé took Thionville in 1643. The village became part of the Kingdom of France. This was confirmed by the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659.

As it was part of Alsace-Moselle, the commune was part of the German Empire from 1871 to 1918. It was annexed by the Third Reich between 1940 and 1944.

Kanfen is next to the Kudertsberg hill, around 230 metres high. The river Kiesel has its source in the village flows through it.

The commune is 12 km north of Thionville and 20 km south of the city of Luxembourg. It is only a few kilometres away from the border with Luxembourg.

The commune regroups Kanfen and Kanfen-sous-Bois.
