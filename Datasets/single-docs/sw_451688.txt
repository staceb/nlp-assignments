They first started in the late 1960s after businessman Pat Hines bought 120 acres (49 ha) in Aldergrove, British Columbia to start a game farm. They opened to the public on August 20, 1970 and were originally known as Vancouver Game Farm. The first animal to arrive there was a llama named "Dennis", who came from Mount Vernon, Washington. The facility was sold in 1991 and was renamed the "Greater Vancouver Zoological Centre" in 1995. After the sale, they built new animal enclosures, a miniature train ride, a picnic park, more landscaping, a remodeled entrance, more parking spaces, informational and educational programs and activities. Ownership changed in 1999 and the zoo was renamed "Greater Vancouver Zoo". The new owners focused on conservation and improving their educational programs.

It was they first time that a major Canadian zoo was charged with cruelty to animals. The case was stayed in January 2007 when crown counsel believed that with the opening of a new habitat for hippos, that it was no longer in the public interest. The zoo lost its Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums accreditation for two years before regaining it back in 2012.
