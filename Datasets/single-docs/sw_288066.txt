Chervil

Chervil, or "Anthriscus cerefolium" is a herb that is related to parsley. It is sometimes called "garden chervil".

Sometimes called "gourmet's parsley", chervil is put in poultry, seafood, and small vegetables. It is particularly famous in France, where it is added to omelettes, salads and soups. More delicate than parsley, it has a small taste of liquorice.

Chervil had several traditional uses. Pregnant women were washed in an infusion of it; a lotion of chervil was used as for cleaning skin; and it was used medicinally as a blood purifier. It was also said to be useful for curing hiccups.
