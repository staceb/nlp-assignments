Hogares CREA

Hogar CREA is a group that helps drug addicts break their habits. It was started in Puerto Rico in 1968 by Javier Garcia Rios "CheJuan". It spread to several Latin American countries and to the US in the early 80's but is on the decline in the US. 

"CREA" is based on the idea of who to better treat drug addiction than an addict. Many people believe that it is a money making scam.
