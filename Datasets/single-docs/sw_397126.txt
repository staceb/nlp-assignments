Dominoes

Dominoes is a game played with small tiles called dominoes. A domino is a rectangular tile with a line in the middle that separates it into two sides. Each side has a number of black spots. The number of spots is different on each domino. Some dominoes have a side that is blank. The games possible with these objects resemble card games.
