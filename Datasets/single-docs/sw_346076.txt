Tapaculo

The tapaculos (pronounced "ta-pa-COO-lo") are a group of small passeriform birds. They have many species, and are found mostly in South America, especially in the Andean regions. Three species, the Choco, the Pale-throated and the Silvery-fronted Tapaculo, are found in southern Central America. Tapaculos nest in many places, from ground burrows to tree holes. Some make a ball nest in a bush.
