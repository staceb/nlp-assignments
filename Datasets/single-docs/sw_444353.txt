Lac-Mégantic derailment

The Lac-Mégantic derailment happened on July 6, 2013 in the town of Lac-Mégantic, Quebec at approximately 01:15 EDT. It happened after an unattended 74-car freight train which was carrying Bakken formation crude oil ran away and derailed. The result was a fire and explosion of multiple tank cars. In the disaster, 42 people were confirmed dead and 5 missing people were presumed dead.

The Lac-Mégantic derailment is the fourth deadliest rail accident in Canadian history, as well as the deadliest rail disaster in Canada since the St-Hilaire train disaster in 1864.

On July 8, Canada's monarch, Queen Elizabeth II, issued a message which expressed her and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh's, "profound sadness [over the] tragic events that have befallen the town of Lac-Mégantic" and hope "that in time it will be possible to rebuild both the property and the lives of those who have been affected." Prime Minister Stephen Harper offered his prayers and condolences to those affected. The President of the United States, Barack Obama, expressed condolences for the "devastating loss of life" and offered American help, if needed.
