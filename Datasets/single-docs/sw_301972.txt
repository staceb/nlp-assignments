Aemilianus

Aemilianus (Marcus Aemilius Aemilianus Augustus) was an emperor of Rome in the 3rd century AD. He ruled for 3 months in 253AD.

He was born in Tunisia in North Africa. He was a military commander and was sent to defend the Danube to defend it.

After defeating the Goths (a barbarian tribe) in modern-day Bulgaria, his soldiers proclaimed him as an Emperor instead of Trebonianus Gallus, the emperor at the time. After defeating Gallus in battle at Interamna (Northern Italy), he captured the capital city of the empire, Rome. 

When Valerianus, Governor of Roman Germany, arrived in Italy, bringing troops to reinforce Gallus, Aemilianus's troops killed him. They did not want a civil war and Valerian had a bigger army than Aemilianus.
