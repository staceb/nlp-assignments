All Night

All Night is a 1918 American silent comedy-drama movie. It stars Carmel Myers and Rudolph Valentino before they became famous. It was directed by Paul Powell. It was released by Universal Pictures, but they used the name Bluebird Photoplays.

The film still exists even after 97 years, and Grapevine Videos put it on DVD in 2005.

The movie is about a young man named Richard Thayer who is in love with a young woman named Beth Lane. He wants to ask her to marry him, but he can't because she is always surrounded by other men who like her and by her father. Richard's friends, William and Maude Harcourt, decide to have a dinner party and invite Richard and Beth so that they can be together. However, the night they plan it, William's business partner shows up for a surprise visit. This causes a lot of problems for Richard, Beth, and the Harcourts.
