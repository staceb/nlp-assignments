Liz Cohen

Liz Cohen (born 1973) is a performance artist. Her best known project is called "Bodywork". She changed an old East German small car (a Trabant), so that it can transform into a larger American car (a Chevrolet). She hired a personal trainer and dieted so she could appear in a bikini to be the model for the car.

She currently teaches at Cranbrook Academy of Art and lives in Detroit, Michigan.
