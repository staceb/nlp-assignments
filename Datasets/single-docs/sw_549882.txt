Jump boot

Jump boots are the combat boots worn by paratroopers. They have calf-length lacing and hard toes. During World War II, many countries came up with their own type of jump boots. The uppers are usually made of smooth black leather that is easy to shine. It is also a paratrooper tradition to lace jump boots in a ladder or cobweb style which increases ankle support during a parachute jump.
