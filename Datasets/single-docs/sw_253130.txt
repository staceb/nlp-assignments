Trampolining

Trampolining is a competitive Olympic sport in which gymnasts perform airborne acrobatics while bouncing on a trampoline. These can include simple jumps in the "pike", "tuck" or "straddle position" to more complex combinations of forward or backward somersaults and twists.

There are two related competitive rebound sports: "synchronized trampoline" and "double mini-trampoline".
The currently accepted basic format for individual trampoline competitions usually consists of two or three "routines", one of which may involve a compulsory set of skills. The skills consist of various combinations of somersaults, shaped bounces, body landings and twists performed in various body positions.

In the early 1930s, an American gymnast George Nissen observed "trapeze" artistes performing tricks when bouncing off the "safety net". He made the first modern trampoline in his garage to reproduce that net on a smaller scale and used it to help with his diving and tumbling activities. It was the beginning of a new sport.

In the USA, trampolining was quickly introduced into school physical education programs and was also used in private entertainment centers. Since trampolining became an Olympic sport in 2000, many countries have started developing programs for producing very competitive athletes.
