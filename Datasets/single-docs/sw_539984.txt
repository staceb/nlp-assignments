Tropical Storm Erika

Tropical Storm Erika in August 2015 was a very damaging and deadly tropical cyclone. The storm struck the Leeward Islands on August 27. More than USD$500 million in damage was caused by the storm.

More than 30 people died when the storm passed through the Caribbean.

Resulting from Erika's impact over the northeast Caribbean, the name "Erika" was retired in April 2016. The name was replaced with "Elsa" for 2021. Erika became the second storm name that was retired. Allison was the first one.
