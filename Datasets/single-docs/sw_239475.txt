VMU

The Sega Dreamcast VMU is a memory card made just for the Sega Dreamcast machine that plays video games. It is put in slot one or two on the Sega Dreamcast controller. It can save games, backgrounds and other extra features for the Sega Dreamcast. Also, it can save minigames that can be played on the remote itself running on a battery using D-pad, A, B, start, and select buttons. The games are shown on a small screen on the controller. (This screen usually shows pictures and game statistics when playing on the Dreamcast).
