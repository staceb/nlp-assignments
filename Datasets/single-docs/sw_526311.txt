Volleyball at the Summer Olympics

Volleyball has been played at the Summer Olympics ever since the 1964 Summer Olympics. The history of Olympic volleyball can be traced back to the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where volleyball was played as part of an American sports demonstration event. It was only added as an Olympic sport, however, after World War II. This was when the FIVB was founded and of some of the continental confederations. In 1957, a special tournament was held at the 53rd IOC session in Sofia, Bulgaria, to support such request. The competition was a success, and the sport was officially introduced in 1964. The Olympic Committee initially dropped volleyball for the 1968 Olympics, meeting protests.
