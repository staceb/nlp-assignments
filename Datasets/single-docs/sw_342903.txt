"Gallipoli" is a faithful portrayal of life in Australia in the 1910s. It captures the ideals and character of the Australians who joined up to fight, as well as the conditions they endured on the battlefield. It does, however, change events for dramatic purposes. It has a number of significant historical inaccuracies.

The many running scenes in the movie are set to Jean Michel Jarre's "Oxygène".
