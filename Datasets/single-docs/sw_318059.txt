Movie censorship

Censorship in movies is the act of giving a movie a very strong film rating systems classification, or banning the movie altogether.

The highest rating label in United Kingdom is 18. These means people under 18 cannot look at, buy or rent any movie under this rating. Movies with such a rating often have very strong language, explicit sexual content or heavy violence. If the content of the movie is higher than the 18 rating, the movie is then banned entirely.

Refused Classification is the very strongest rating in Australia. This rating means a movie has been banned from a part of Australia. In some cases, it has been banned in all of the country. This rating is tagged onto movies which the Australian Classification Board has said are too severe for viewing by general public.

The movie rating is NC-17 in the United States. This means No Children 17 and Under Admitted. Such movies contain strong sexual content, very strong violence or extremely graphic language and are usually considered too intense for an R rating.

The highest rating label in Canada is R. This means nobody under 18 may view, buy, rent, or watch any movie under this rating. Movie with this rating have strong sexual content/nudity, prolonged scenes of graphic violence, strong coarse language, graphic horror, and other disturbing content
