Amphisbaenia

Amphisbaenia are a suborder of Squamata. 

Amphisbaenians have features that link them to both lizards and snakes, but they have enough of their own features to be a separate suborder. Amphisbaenians can live both above and below the ground. 

There are four families, made up of 18 genera, and about 160 species.
