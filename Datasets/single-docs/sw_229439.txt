Life Less Frightening

"Life Less Frightening" was the third single from the Chicago punk rock band Rise Against, from their 2004 album, Siren Song of the Counter Culture. It is the third track on the album and runs about 3 minutes and 44 seconds.

The lyrics of the song tell of the horrors of the world and a longing for a "life less frightening" ("...I'm soaking with the sins of knowing what's gone wrong...") and tells that lack of action will only cause the problems to worsen ("Time again I have found myself stuttering/Foundations pulled out from under me.").
