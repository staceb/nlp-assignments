Against the Grain

Against the Grain is the fifth album by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on the Californian independent record label Epitaph Records on November 23, 1990. After the release of this album, drummer Pete Finestone left Bad Religion in 1991 to concentrate with his new project The Fishermen. Following his departure, their music would take a different direction on their next album, 1992's "Generator".

"Against the Grain" was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's success with their last two albums, "Suffer" and "No Control". Even though "Against the Grain" still did not break Bad Religion into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing.

The album's 13th track, "21st Century (Digital Boy)", was re-recorded and appeared on their eighth full-length studio album "Stranger Than Fiction". The "Stranger Than Fiction" version of that song made Bad Religion even more popular.
