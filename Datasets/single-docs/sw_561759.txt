Cree language

Cree (also known as Cree–Montagnais–Naskapi) is an Algonquian language spoken by about 117,000 people across Canada from the Northwest Territories and Alberta to Labrador. This makes it the aboriginal language with the highest number of speakers in Canada. Despite having a large number of speakers within this wide-ranging area, the only region where Cree has any official status is in the Northwest Territories. This is along with eight other official aboriginal languages.
