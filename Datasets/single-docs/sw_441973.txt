Appomattox Campaign

The Appomattox Campaign was a military campaign during the American Civil War. It happened in 1865 in Virginia. At the start of the campaign from March 30–April 1, 1865, Union general U.S. Grant captured Petersburg, Virginia. Confederate general Robert E. Lee tried to get the Army of Northern Virginia moved to North Carolina, so he could fight along with other Confederate soldiers. But Grant surrounded Lee's army at Appomattox Courthouse and forced Lee to surrender. After Lee's surrender, other Confederate armies started to surrender too.
