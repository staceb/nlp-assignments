Brassica rapa

Brassica rapa L. (syn. Brassica campestris L.), commonly known as turnip, turnip rape, fast plants, field mustard, or turnip mustard, is a plant widely cultivated as a leaf vegetable (see mizuna and napa cabbage), a root vegetable (see turnip), and an oilseed (but not normally rapeseed oil, from a different "Brassica" species).

The oilseeds known as canola are sometimes particular varieties of "Brassica rapa" (termed Polish Canola) but mostly the related species "Brassica napus" and "Brassica juncea".
