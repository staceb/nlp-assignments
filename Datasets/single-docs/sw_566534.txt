Leg-of-mutton sail

A leg-of-mutton sail (LOM) is a simple triangular sail set on a long spar mounted horizontally on the mast. It runs in a fore-and-aft direction. The leg-of-mutton uses a spar mounted high instead of a boom. This gives the helmsman more visibility and there is no boom hit his or her head on. It is a favorite type of sail for small boats. These include puddle ducks and canoes. A LOM is very similar to a spritsail. But instead of being square or having four corners, the LOM has three. Instead of the spar being mounted diagonally, as with the spritsail, it is mounted horizontally.
