Treacle

Treacle (Also known as Molasses in the United States (Molasses in the UK refers to treacle not made for humans to eat)) is a type of syrup. It is made when people are processing the plant sugarcane. It is used in cooking to make things sweeter. It is usually dark brown.

Doctors used the word "treacle" to describe a medicine with many ingredients, or medicines that would treat snakebites. Wells that were thought to have water that would cure people were called "treacle wells".
