Championship

In sport, a championship is a competition to determine which individual or team is the champion.

Different forms of competition can be called a championship. It is usually the final competition in a tournament (a series of competitions). For example, the FIFA World Cup is a tournament held every four years. The winner of the final competition of each tournament becomes that tournament's champion. In a league system, the championship is the final competition of a regular season. In some league systems, a series of playoffs is used to determine the champion of a season. There is one champion for each season.

In combat sports, such as wrestling and boxing, a competitor must challenge the current champion to win the championship.
