Solo (music)

In musical performance, a solo is a piece or a section of a piece that is played or sung by a single performer. This performer is called a "soloist". A soloist can be a singer or an instrumentalist.

Solos are common in classical music and jazz. In popular music, a "solo" is an improvised melody played by a single performer, such as a guitar solo. In the country music genre a solo is known as a "ride".
