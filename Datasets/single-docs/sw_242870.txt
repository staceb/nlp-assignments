Dacarbazine

Dacarbizine is a type of drug used to fight cancer. It works by changing DNA, which makes cancer cells grow more slowly or completely stop growing. It is used against metastatic melanoma. Only about 15.3% of people who use the drug respond to it. People who use this drug do not live any longer as a result.

It has side effects, including less blood cells, damage to the liver. I can also sometimes make other types of cancer start growing.
