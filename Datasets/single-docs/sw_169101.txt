Massively multiplayer online game

Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) are video games where players play together over the internet. These games are different from other online video games because they have very many players all playing with each other at the same time. Other online video games have fewer players playing with each other at the same time. The most popular kind of MMOG is the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG). Examples are "RuneScape", "World of Warcraft" (WOW) and "Roblox".
