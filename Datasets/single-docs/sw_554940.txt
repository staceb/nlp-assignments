Seven Kings School

Seven Kings School (used to be known as "Seven Kings High School") is a mixed comprehensive (primary and secondary) school in Ilford in East London], England. For students aged 4–18 years old, Seven Kings School has a separate Primary school and Secondary school buildings, which are close to each other. Seven Kings has also took part in and won awards (which are well known around the UK), such as, The Jack Petchey Award and are known as a National Teaching School. Seven Kings were the first to work to include pupils with special needs and disabilities.

Seven Kings Primary School is a four-form entry school (they have four classes for each year group), with 120 reception children who started in September 2015.  While they move up, a 120 more children will start going to the school, every year. The school will be full by September 2021, when the original class of reception children becomes Year 6. These first children will be the original year groups of the school and will see the school grow, as they move up through it. All children who go to Seven Kings Primary will be allowed to move on to Seven Kings High School, if they or their parents choose to do so.

Seven Kings also has a sixth form (Year 12 and Year 13). The sixth form allows more students than the secondary school and allows pupils from boroughs and towns next to Redbridge. More than a hundred students are from another school but this can change on how many Year 11s carry on. You can pick up to four A-Levels there.

In 2007, the school inspectors (Ofsted) gave Seven Kings High School a Grade 1 or an 'outstanding' - this is the highest award they can give.

In 2009, Ofsted have said that SKHS is one of the twelve 'outstanding' schools that help people who wouldn't have found any or 'disadvantaged communities'.
