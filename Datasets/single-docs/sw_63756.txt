Boredom

Boredom is an emotional state that comes when a person has nothing to do, and is not interested in anything. To stop boredom, most people do something to occupy or amuse themselves. 

The first known use of the word "boredom" is in the novel "Bleak House" by Charles Dickens, written in 1852, but the saying "to be a bore" had been used to mean "to be tiresome or dull" since 1768.

Psychologically, boredom is a bad state in which the person feels a deep lack of interest in what is going on around them, and where it is hard to focus.
