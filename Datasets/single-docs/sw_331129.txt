Adolphe Adam

Adolphe Charles Adam (24 July 1803 – 3 May 1856) was a French composer and music critic. He composed many operas and ballets. He is best known today for his ballets "Giselle" (1841) and "Le corsaire" (1856, his last work), and his operas "Le postillon de Lonjumeau" (1836), "Le toréador" (1849), and "Si j'étais roi" (1852, often regarded as his finest work). He also composed the popular Christmas carol "Minuit, chrétiens!" ("O Holy Night") (1847). Adam was also a teacher. Léo Delibes was among his pupils.
