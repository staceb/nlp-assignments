Brive

Brive-la-Gaillarde, commonly called Brive, is the subprefecture of the Corrèze departement. Until 1919, the name of the city was Brive; since then it has been known as Brive-la-Gaillarde. About 50.000 people live in the city, and close to 100.000 in its urban area. The city goes back to antiquity; its name simply means bridge. In this case, the Corrèze was easy to cross at this place. Gundoald was elected king of Aquitaine in Brive, in the year 584.
