Peripheral artery disease

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a disease of the blood vessels in the legs. It can cause leg pain with walking, or if it gets bad it can cause wounds on the skin of the feet and toes. Peripheral artery disease is a serious disease that can be fatal. Some people who get very sick from PAD may need surgery to improve blood flow in their legs and feet. If their feet get really sick they may need an amputation.

PA is also sometimes called peripheral artery occlusive disease (PAOD), peripheral obliterative arteriopathy, or peripheral vascular disease (PVD).
