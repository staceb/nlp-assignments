Nickel silver

Nickel silver, sometimes called German silver, is an alloy. It normally has copper, nickel, and zinc in it. Despite the name, it does not contain any real silver. It is common in utensils. It is also used in cymbals, keys, zippers, and musical instruments. Some coins use nickel silver. It is sometimes used to trick people into thinking it is silver. A German industrial chemist named E.A. Geitner discovered nickel silver in the early 19th century.
