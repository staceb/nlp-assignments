Dave Farrell

David Michael Farrell (born February 8, 1977), also known as Phoenix because he is believed to have a tattoo of a phoenix on his back, is Linkin Park’s bassist.

Farrell was born in Plymouth, Massachusetts, but when he was five he moved to Mission Viejo, California where he attended Mission Viejo High School. He graduated in 1999 at the University of California, Los Angeles. He can play bass guitar, electric guitar, cello and violin.

Farrell was a member of a Christian punk/ska band called Tasty Snax. While he was at the college, he shared the room with his friend Brad Delson, and they practiced together. 

He had to go on tour with the Tasty Snax so he could not play with Delson and his band. Then, Farrell left his band to play bass with Brad Delson in the band Xero in 1996 but then left in 1998. He then rejoined Xero now called Linkin Park in November 2000 and has been playing with them ever since.
