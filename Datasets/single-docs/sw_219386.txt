Squirrel monkey

Squirrel monkeys live in Central and South America. They grow to 25 to 35 cm, and their long tail is 35 to 42 cm. long. Squirrel monkeys are small enough to go on the smallest branches to get food. They eat fruits and insects. When fruit is scarce, they will drink nectar. Large falcons and snakes eat them so they have lots of different warning calls.
