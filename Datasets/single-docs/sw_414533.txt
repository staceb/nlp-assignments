Enfield State Park

The Enfield State Park, also known as the Enfield State Forest, is a large forest reserve south of Ballarat, Victoria, Australia. It covers an area of about 4,600 hectares. The Enfield State Park was once the site for gold mining, and there are many gold mining relics in the area. There was a Chinese settlement at Surface Point during the gold rush. There were temples, tearooms, gaming tents, herbalists and market gardens. People are still able to go searching for gold in the park. 

Timber from the forest was used for mining and building. There was a eucalyptus distillery at the town of Enfield, making eucalyptus oil.

There are also picnic areas and walking trails through the park.

The forest is an open dry forest, with messmates, peppermints, swamp gums, manna gums and the rare Yarra Gum. Over 100 bird species, and 22 native mammal species have been seen in the park.
