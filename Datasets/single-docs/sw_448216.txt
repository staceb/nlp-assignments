Biochemical cascade

A biochemical cascade (or signalling pathway) is a series of chemical reactions. It is started by a stimulus (first messenger) acting on a receptor. The 'message' is passed on to the cell interior through other reactions. These later chemical reactions amplify (build up) the initial signal. Eventually there is a cell response to the initial stimulus. The passing series of chemical changes is a cascade, and the whole process is called signal transduction.
