Philo T. Farnsworth

Philo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 - March 11, 1971) was an American inventor. He was from Beaver, Utah and grew up in Idaho. He was a Mormon and went to college at Brigham Young University. 

He is one of several people who can claim to have invented television. He invented the picture tube and built the first all-electric TV set. He had built his first prototype in 1927, and presented it in 1928. For the next few years, Farnsworth fought a battle with RCA over his patents. By 1936, he was filming television programs. He did a lot of research in nuclear fusion. He also invented the modern method of air-traffic control.

A statue of Farnsworth represents Utah in the United States Capitol.
