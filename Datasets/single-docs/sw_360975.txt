Slip-on shoe

Slip-on shoes are laceless shoes. The style most commonly seen is called a loafer or slipper, with a moccasin construction. They began appearing in mid 1930s Norway as casual shoes, though they have increased in popularity to the point of being worn with lounge suits. They are worn mostly by females, though men wear the shoes, also.
