Precancerous condition

A precancerous (or premalignant) condition is not malignant. However, it has the potential to become cancer if proper treatment is not taken in time.

A premalignant lesion is a visually (morphologically) altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than its normal counterpart.

The condition was named in 1875 by Romanian physician Victor Babeş.
