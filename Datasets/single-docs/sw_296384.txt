Hominina is a sub-tribe of the hominid primates. It is used by some anthropologists to include the upright biped apes, including the genus "Homo".

If an anthropologist wants to includes chimpanzees in the tribe Hominini, then it follows that a sub-tribe is needed to put Australopithecines and humans in. But this is not a majority view at present, and the mainstream view is:

Over the decades of the 20th century, there were fossil finds of pre-human and early human species from late Miocene and early Pliocene times.

Classifying a fossil as "Homo" means evidences of:
