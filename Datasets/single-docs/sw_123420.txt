Dudipatsar Lake

Dudiptsar lake or Dudipat Lake is a lake in Pakistan. It is in the extreme north of Kaghan Valley. It is about a four-hour drive from the chief town Naran. The word "dudi" means white and "sar" means lake. The lake was named because it reflects the white color of snow on the mountain peaks around it. The lake's water is greenish blue and very cold.

The lake used to have a lot of trout. Now there aren't as many because of illegal fishing using dynamite and nets.

This lake is very little visited by people. Getting to the lake takes four to six hours of tough hiking and trekking. The earthquake on October 8, 2005 in North Pakistan made it more difficult to get to the lake. However, the government of Pakistan decided on March 14, 2006 to take all steps to restore tourism of the Kaghan valley. That includes building new tourism spots and rebuilding previously destroyed ones.

Dudipatsar is close to another major lake, Lake Lulusar, which is the main contributory to the Kunhar River that runs through Kaghan valley. The whole area is private property but declared national park by Government of Pakistan.

The area is accessible for four months every year from June-September. After that, it is closed because of snow.
