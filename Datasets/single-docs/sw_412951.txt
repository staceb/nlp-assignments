Sweet roll

A sweet roll (or sweet bun) refers to any kind of bread roll or bun that is made to taste sweet. They are eaten as a breakfast or dessert food. They may contain spices, nuts, fruits, and are often glazed or topped with icing. Compared to regular bread dough, sweet roll dough generally has more sugar, fat, eggs and yeast. They are often round, and are small enough to be eaten by one person. They are different to pastries, which are made from a paste-like batter, and from cakes, which are usually not leavened like bread is. They are also not the same as doughnuts, which are deep fried.
