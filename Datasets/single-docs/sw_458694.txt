New Zealand Parliament

The New Zealand Parliament is the legislature of New Zealand. Currently, it has only one chamber, the House of Representatives, which has 120 members.

The parliament was created by the British parliament with the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852. It used to have an upper chamber, the New Zealand Legislative Council, but it was abolished in 1962. There have been several proposals to create a new upper chamber but none have passed into law.
