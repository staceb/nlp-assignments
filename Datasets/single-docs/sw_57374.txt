Cthulhu

Cthulhu is a fictional deity created by the horror writer H. P. Lovecraft. Cthulhu is a powerful monster from another planet. It (Cthulhu is neither male nor female) is very ancient compared to humans, being around since the dinosaurs. It has the alien appearance of a large green dragon with the head of a squid and human-like hands. There is said to be many people that worship it as their deity because of his powers over the mind. 

Cthulhu is one of the Great Old Ones, a group of powerful beings from another place that now inhabit Earth, waiting to rise up(when the stars are right) and destroy the human race so they can rule the planet. The Old Ones are neither good nor evil, meaning that they do not hate humans, they just do not care about them. They think of humans as if they could be ants. Also, their appearance is so unlike anything of this world, that it is said that any human who so much as gazes upon one of them will go insane. 

In one of Lovecraft's stories, "The Call of Cthulhu", he said that Cthulhu currently lies in a dreamlike state in the underwater sunken city of R'lyeh (rill-ee-yeh), waiting for the time when the Old Ones shall rise again. In the story, R'lyeh is located in the southern Pacific Ocean.
