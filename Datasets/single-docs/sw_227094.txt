Bromsgrove is a town in the north of Worcestershire. The town is about north-east of Worcester and south-west of Birmingham. 29,237 people lived there in 2001.

The layer of rock underneath Bromsgrove is mainly sandstone. The soil is very good for growing vegetables. The altitude of the town is above sea level. 

The climate in Bromsgrove is like most of the United Kingdom. It is an "oceanic climate." This means it is cool in summer and not very cold in winter. It can rain at any time of the year.

The main A38 road goes through Bromsgrove. The M5 motorway passes by the west side of the town. The M42 motorway starts at the north of the town.

Bromsgrove train station is in the south of the town. The station is at the bottom of the "Lickey Incline". The Lickey Incline is the steepest hill for trains in Britain. An extra locomotive has to help push heavy freight trains up the hill. There are many passenger trains to Birmingham, Worcester and Hereford. There is a plan to build a new, better train station in Bromsgrove. The new station will cost about £10 million to £12 million.

There is also a bus station in the town centre. Buses travel from the bus station to many places in Worcestershire and the West Midlands.
