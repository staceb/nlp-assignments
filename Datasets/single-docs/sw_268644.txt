Vulcanodon

Vulcanodon was a long-necked dinosaur that lived during the early Jurassic period, about 208 to 201 million years ago. It was an early sauropod. 

A partial fossil has been found in Mashonaland North, Zimbabwe, Africa.
"Vulcanodon" was about 20 feet (6.5 m) long. It was a long-necked, long-tailed plant-eater with a small head, thick legs, and a bulky body. It had nail-like claws on its feet and an enlarged claw on each big toe. Its front legs were relatively long.
