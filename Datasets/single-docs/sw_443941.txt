Shea Weber

Shea Michael Weber (born August 14, 1985) is a Canadian ice hockey defenceman. He currently plays for the Nashville Predators of the National Hockey League (NHL). He serves as their captain.

Before playing in the NHL, Weber played 3 seasons with the Kelowna Rockets of the Western Hockey League (WHL). During his time there, he was able to win the Memorial Cup with the Rockets and won the WHL airBC Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Playoffs.

He was drafted with the 49th overall pick by the Nashville Predators in the 2003 NHL Entry Draft. On July 8, 2010, he was named the fifth captain in Nashville Predators history, replacing Jason Arnott, who was traded to the New Jersey Devils. He became the youngest captain in Predators history and was the only captain of the Predators to have been drafted by the team.

During the 2012 offseason, the Predators were unable to take Weber to arbitration again (a player can only be subjected to team-elected arbitration once in his career). Weber signed a front-loaded $110 million, 14-year offer sheet, $68 million of it as a signing bonus, with the Philadelphia Flyers on July 19. It was the richest contract in NHL history in terms of total money, money per season, and length, which surpassed the previous offer sheet record set by Thomas Vanek. The Predators, who had already lost Weber's defensive partner Ryan Suter to unrestricted free agency, were able to match the offer sheet five days later.

On June 29th 2016, Shea Weber was traded to the Montreal Canadiens for P.K. Subban.
