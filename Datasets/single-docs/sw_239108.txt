Ice-nine

Ice-nine is a fictional material. It was invented by author Kurt Vonnegut in his novel, "Cat's Cradle". Ice-nine was a special type of ice that would freeze at higher temperatures than normal ice. When dropped into other bodies of water, it froze that, too, which resulted in all bodies of water on earth being frozen by Ice-nine.
