Mississippi mud pie

Mississippi mud pie is a chocolate-based dessert pie. The treat has a gooey chocolate sauce on top of crumbly chocolate. The pie is usually served with ice cream. 

It is popular because of the amount of chocolate in each serving.

The name "Mississippi mud pie" comes from the dense cake which looks like the banks of the Mississippi River.

It is believed that this dish was made by home cooks after World War II. This is because it was made of simple ingredients that could be found at any supermarket and did not need any special cooking tools.
