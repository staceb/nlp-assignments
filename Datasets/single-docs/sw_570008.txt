Side chain

A side chain in organic chemistry is a chemical group. It is attached to the molecule's "main chain" or backbone. A side chain is also known as a pendant chain.

Alkyl (saturated hydrocarbon) group side chains are represented by the placeholder R. Other non-carbon groups can be represented by X, Y, or Z.
