Blackwall DLR station

Blackwall is a station on Docklands Light Railway (DLR) in east London. The station is close to the northern entry to the Blackwall road tunnel under the Thames.

The DLR station opened, with the Beckton Branch, on the 28 March 1994. There was a previous station on the same site, called Poplar station, which was served by the London and Blackwall Railway from 6 July 1840 to 3 May 1926. Blackwall station on the London and Blackwall Railway was actually farther east. The location of these two stations on the London and Blackwall Railway can be seen in the bottom-right hand corner of the Map of Poplar, 1885.
