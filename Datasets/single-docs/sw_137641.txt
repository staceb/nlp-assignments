Aziz Mian

Aziz Mian Qawwal () (April 17, 1942 – December 6, 2000) was a Pakistani singer, most famous for his performing of Qawwalis. Aziz Mian was born as Abdul Aziz () in Delhi, British India. The exclamation "Mian", which he often used in his qawwalis, became part of his stage name. He began to introduce himself as Aziz Mian Mairthi. The word "Mairthi" refers to Meerut, a city in northern India, from which he migrated to Pakistan in 1947.

At the age of ten, he began learning the art of Qawwali under the tutelage of Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan. He received sixteen years of training at the Data Ganj Baksh School of Lahore, and obtained a degree in Urdu literature from the University of Punjab, Lahore.
