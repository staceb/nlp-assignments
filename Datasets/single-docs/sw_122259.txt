Saint-Maurice-d'Ardèche

Saint-Maurice was built around a Benedictine convent in the 11th century. The commune changed its name many times. Before the French Revolution the name was "Saint-Maurice-Terlin" (contraction of "Terre à lin" - Land of Flax) because the inhabitants grew flax. The village then became "Saint Maurice Torsinet" in 1793. Eight years later, in 1801, the name was changed again, first to "Saint-Maurice-en-Lanas" then
"Saint-Maurice-et-Lanas". In 1846 it was simply "Saint-Maurice". The current name, "Saint-Maurice-d'Ardèche" appeared between 1846 and 1861. It is because the commune is close to the river "Ardèche".

The village is between the communes of Aubenas and Ruoms. It is close to the river "Ardèche". There are many vineyards there.
