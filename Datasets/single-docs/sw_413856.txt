Castaways of the Flying Dutchman

Castaways of the Flying Dutchman is the first book in the "Castaways of the Flying Dutchman" series written by Brian Jacques. It was published in 2001. It is based on the legend of the ghost ship the "Flying Dutchman". A 13-year-old boy named Nebuchadnezzar (Neb for short, later he switches that backwards and becomes Ben), and his dog, Denmark (Den for short, later switched backwards to Ned), are the lone survivors of the "Flying Dutchman". They have to wander the earth forever, and will stay forever young, helping those who need help.

The second book, "The Angel's Command" was published in 2003. "Voyage of Slaves" (the third and last book) was published in 2006.
