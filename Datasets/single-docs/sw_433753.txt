Vesper bat

The Vesper bat is a species of bat belonging to the Microchiroptera family. It is the largest and most well-known species belonging to that family. The bats can be found in different parts of all continents except Antarctica. They are thought to have originally come from somewhere in North America.

The Vesper bat can range from in length. They have brown or grey colored fur. Like most bats, the Vesper bat relies on echolocation to navigate in flight, and find its prey. This is very useful because they cannot see, and live in caves or other dark, empty, damp areas.
