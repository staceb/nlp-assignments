It was founded by Mary Scranton who came to Korea as a Christian missionary in 1885. This school opened in 1886 as a mission school, and the name "Ewha" was granted by Gojong, the 26th king of the Joseon dynasty. It literally means pear blossoms, but the internal meaning is "Be white, clear, innocent like pear blossoms".
