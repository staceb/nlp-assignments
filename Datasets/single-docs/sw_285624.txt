Systems engineering

Systems engineering is a field of engineering that deals with complex engineering projects which should be designed and managed over the life cycle of the project. Therefore, issues such as logistics, the coordination of different teams, and automatic control of machinery become really complicated. Systems engineering deals with work-processes and tools to handle such projects. For this, it applies both technical and human-centered disciplines such as control engineering, industrial engineering, organizational studies, and project management.
