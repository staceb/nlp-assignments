Qualia

Qualia is a term philosophers use for bits of perception or subjective, conscious experience. It is in the field called the philosophy of psychology, or philosophy of mind.

Examples of qualia include the pain of a headache, the taste of wine, or the perceived redness of an evening sky. It is a separate bit of experience, different from thinking about propositions or stream of consciousness thought.

Daniel Dennett (b. 1942), American philosopher and cognitive scientist, says "qualia" is "an unfamiliar term for something that could not be more familiar to each of us: the ways things seem to us".
