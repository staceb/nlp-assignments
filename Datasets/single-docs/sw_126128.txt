If I Never See Your Face Again

"If I Never See Your Face Again" is the fourth single by Maroon 5. The song is the first track on the album "It Won't Be Soon Before Long". The song was remixed to feature Rihanna. The music video takes place in what looks like a 19th century room while Rihanna and Levine seem to be arguing over a romantic relationship.

"If I Never See Your Face Again" was performed at Quebec to be the opening song of the live album by Maroon 5 called "Live from Le Cabaret". The song was not performed in its single version (with Rihanna).
