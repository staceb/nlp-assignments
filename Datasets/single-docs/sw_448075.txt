Forgot About Dre

"Forgot About Dre" is the second single off American hip hop musician Dr. Dre's second studio album "2001". The song was released in January 29, 2000 and features vocals from Eminem. The song won a Grammy Award for "Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group" in 2001.

It was called a stand-out track by Stephen Thomas Erlewine. NME said of the song: "In case folks been smoking too much heavy 'chronic' lately, West Coast rap founder and scary legend Andre Young, aka Dr Dre, jogs their memories on 'Forgot About Dre'. "Who you think brought you the Eazy Es, Ice Cubes and DOCs, the Snoop- D-O-G-Gs and the group that said motherf-- the police?" yammers the one-time NWA lynchpin, ex Death Row playa, inventor of - G-Funk and occasional breaker of rival producers' jaws. Yo, indeed, big bad Dre's back and, despite a four-year gap since his last hardcore missive, the Doc's recent collaboration with Eminem on 'The Slim Shady LP' has kept his legend simmering." The song also won an MTV Video Music Award for "Best Rap Video" in 2000.
