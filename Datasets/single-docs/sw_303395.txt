Galápagos penguin

Galápagos penguins ("Spheniscus mendiculus") live on the Galápagos Islands. Because these islands are at the equator, the waters are warm not all penguins live in cold climates. They do not migrate.

Galapagos penguins have two bands of brown feathers on their faces and their beaks are thin and slender.

They weigh five pounds and are one and a half feet tall.
