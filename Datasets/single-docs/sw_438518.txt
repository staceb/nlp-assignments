Hurricane Cleo

Hurricane Cleo was an intense hurricane that happened in late August-early September 1964. The highest winds speeds were measured at 140 miles per hour on 23 August. The storm went across Guadeloupe and Hispaniola, killing 214. It later struck from southeastern Florida to Virginia. Overall damage was just over $198 million in 1964 USD.

Due to high death count and severe damage, the name Cleo was retired in the spring of 1965.
