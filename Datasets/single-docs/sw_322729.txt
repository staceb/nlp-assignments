Xtranormal

Xtranormal is a website that hosts text-to-speech based computer animated videoclips, featuring animated three-dimensional characters speaking in monotone computer voices. Users who log into the site may create videos by scripting the dialog and choosing from a menu of camera angles and predesigned characters and scenes. Xtranormal videos may also be created through an interface on the Youtube web site, and Xtranormal's animation software, called State, may be downloaded free and run offline.

Xtranormal launched in October, 2008, after four years of earlier software development. Although it was originally intended as a way for filmmakers to quickly produce storyboards, its emphasis shifted towards satires of workplace misbehavior after one of its videos, about a cellphone salesman, went viral.

In 2010, the short movie "Sleeping with Charlie Kaufman" by director J. Roland Kelly, animated entirely with Xtranormal, premiered at the Little Rock Film Festival and was shown at The Rome International Film Festival in Rome, Georgia. Xtranormal videos form a recurring feature on the late night Fox talk show Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld, and have been featured as part of a GEICO advertising campaign.On July 31, 2013, Xtranormal was shut down officially.
