Mono-ski

A mono-ski is a sled used by a skier with paraplegia, spina bifida, muscular dystrophy, or cerebral palsy. Mono-skis are used only in para-alpine skiing. People who use mono-skis need good balance to stop themselves from falling over. The mono-ski has a chair with one ski attached to the bottom.

People first used mono-skis in 1985 in the United States. Mono-skis allow skiers to ski using the same way that people who stand ski down a hill.

Mono-skis have a hydraulic lift. This makes it easier for a skier to get in and out of the mono-ski.
