Ixelles Ponds

The Ixelles Ponds are two ponds in the Brussels municipality of Ixelles. They are between the Abbey of La Cambre and Flagey Square. 

With the surrounding park, the Ixelles Ponds reach from the Sonian Forest to the center of Brussels. The ponds are a very popular place for local residents. However, the water is polluted and signs are all around the ponds. The total lengths are 700 metres (2,200 feet), and widths are 50 metres (170 feet). The ponds are separated by land.
