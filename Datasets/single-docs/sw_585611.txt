Bradypus pygmaeus

Bradypus pygmaeus is a species of three toed sloth. It lives on the island of Escudo de Veraguas. It is listed as critically endangered on IUCN's Red List, due to its location range being less than 5 square kilometers and because of deforestation of the mangroves in which they live. The pygmy three toed sloth is not prey to any natural predator, as it lives on an isolated island where there aren't many other animals.

Pygmy three toed sloths eat the leaves from various trees.

The fur of the pygmy three toed sloth is covered with algae. The algae is camouflage. They have long arms and curved claws that help them hold onto the trees. They have a slow metabolic rate that allows them to digest one leaf in up to a month.
