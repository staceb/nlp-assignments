Chrism

The chrism is a mixture of pure olive oil and balm (balsam). The two elements signify "fullness of grace". The chrism is blessed by a bishop on Maundy Thursday. It is used to consecrate churches, chalices, the solemn blessing of bells, baptismal fonts, etc. It is also used in baptisms, confirmations, and other churchly functions.
