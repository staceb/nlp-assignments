Ganges Delta

The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta is a river delta in the South Asia region of Bangladesh and in West Bengal, India. It is the world's largest delta.

The delta is also known as the Brahmaputra Delta, the "Sunderbans Delta", or the Bengal Delta. Because it is also one of the most fertile regions in the world, it is called The Green Delta.

The Ganges Delta empties into the Bay of Bengal. It is approximately across at the Bay of Bengal.. The floodplain is from three rivers: Ganges, the Brahmaputra River and the Meghna River.

The delta stretches from the Hooghly River on the west to the Meghna River on the east. In India Kolkata and Haldia are the main seaports. In Bangladesh the main seaports are the Port of Mongla and Chittagong.
