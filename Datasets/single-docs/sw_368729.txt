David Tonkin

Dr David Oliver Tonkin AO (20 July 1929 – 2 October 2000) was the 38th Premier of South Australia, from 18 September 1979 to 10 November 1982. He was elected to the South Australian parliament in the 1970 election. He became the state's leader of the Liberal Party in 1975. His party won the state elections in 1979, after Don Dunstan of the Labor Party had resigned as premier.

Tonkin's government focused on the economy while also continuing the socially progressive ideas of the previous government. He developed copper and uranium mining in the state, and made laws against discrimination. He also passed a land rights act through parliament that gave the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people ownership over most of their homeland in South Australia.

Tonkin's party ran for a second term in 1982, but was defeated by the Labor Party, which was led by John Bannon.
