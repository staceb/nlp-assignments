Eugène Terre'Blanche

Eugène Ney Terre'Blanche (January 31, 1941 – April 3, 2010) was a Boer-Afrikaner who founded the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB). He was born in Ventersdorp, South Africa. During the apartheid regime, and afterwards, he fought for Afrikaner separatism. He had convictions for illegally possessing weapons, assault and attempted murder. He was murdered in Ventersdorp at age 69 by two black males in 2010 while he was taking a nap. He left behind a widow named Martie and a daughter Bea.

Other South African politicians, whites and blacks, have reacted to the killings in shock. Black politicians have send their condolences to the family of Terre'Blanche. The murder resulted in racial tensions, but the AWB asked its members not to use violence and stay calm.

The murderers of Terre'Blanche said they worked for him on his farm. They claimed he could not pay them and so they killed him and took his money. They hit him with machetes, knobkiris and iron pipes, and pulled down his trousers.
