Pedobear

Pedobear is an internet meme that gained popularity on 4chan. Pedobear is usually posted as a way to mock users requesting or posting sexualized images of children on 4chan.

Pedobear first appeared on 2channel, a popular bulletin board system in Japan and was originally called Kumā (interjection of Kuma which means bear in Japanese) or Safety Bear.

Pedobear has also been featured as iStockphoto wallpaper and was in the background of a cover of the auto magazine Import Tuner.

On July 3, 2009, Michael R. Barrick, a Canadian artist had created two pictures showing Pedobear together with the mascots of 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. Gazeta Olsztyńska, a Polish newspaper mistakenly used one of the pictures for a February 4, 2010 front page story about the Olympics in Vancouver.
