Lynne Stewart

Lynne Irene Stewart (October 8, 1939 – March 7, 2017) was an American defense attorney and convicted criminal. She was known for representing controversial, poor, and often unpopular defendants. She was convicted of helping pass messages from her client, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric convicted of planning terror attacks, in 2005.

Stewart was called a "radial leftist American lawyer" by The New York Times.

Stewart was born in Brooklyn, New York. She was raised in Queens, New York. She studied at Wagner College and at Rutgers University in Newark, New Jersey.

Stewart was convicted on charges of conspiracy and providing material support to terrorists in 2005, and sentenced to 28 months in prison. Her felony conviction led to her being automatically disbarred. She was convicted of helping pass messages from her client, Sheikh Omar Abdel-Rahman, an Egyptian cleric convicted of planning terror attacks, to his followers in al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, an organization designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the United States Secretary of State.

She was re-sentenced on July 15, 2010, to 10 years in prison in light of her perjury at trial. She served her sentence at the Federal Medical Center, Carswell, a federal prison in Fort Worth, Texas.

Stewart was released from prison on December 31, 2013 on a compassionate release order because of her terminal breast cancer diagnosis.

Stewart died at her home in Brooklyn, New York from a stroke and complications of breast cancer, aged 77.
