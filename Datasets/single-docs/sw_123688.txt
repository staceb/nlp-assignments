Ladakh Range

The Ladakh Range is a segment of the Karakoram Range, that extends southeastward for 230 miles (370 km) from the mouth of the Shyok River in the Ladakh region to the Tibetan/Chinese border. With a crest line of about 20,000 feet (6,100 m), the range parallels the northeast bank of the Indus River.
