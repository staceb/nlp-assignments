Bluebell

Bluebells are a genus of flowering plants in the family Asparagaceae, Hyacinthoides.

Bluebells are famous as indicator species (markers) for ancient woodland, where they carpet the forest floor in springtime. They grow in shade rather than in sunny areas.

"Hyacinthoides" is differentiated by the presence of two bracts at the base of each flower, rather than one bract per flower or no bracts in other closely-related genera.

According to the "World Checklist of Selected Plant Families" , the genus contains 11 species and one interspecific hybrid. Most species are distributed around the Mediterranean Basin, with only one species in northwestern Europe.
