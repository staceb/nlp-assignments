Jorge Rafael Videla

Jorge Rafael Videla (2 August 1925 – 17 May 2013) was a senior commander in the Argentine Army who was the "de facto" President of Argentina from 1976 to 1981.

Videla was born on 2 August 1925 in Mercedes, Buenos Aires, Argentina. He studied at the National Military College (Colegio Militar de la Nación). Videla married Alicia Raquel Hartridge in 1948.

Videla came to power in a coup d'état that deposed Isabel Martínez de Perón. After the return of a representative democratic government in 1983, he was prosecuted for large-scale human rights abuses and crimes against humanity that took place under his rule. These included:

Videla remained married to his wife Alicia until his death in 2013. They had seven children.

He was under house arrest until 10 October 2008, when he was sent to a military prison. On 22 December 2010, Videla was sentenced to life in a non-military prison for the deaths of 31 prisoners after his coup d'état. On 5 July 2012, Videla was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the systematic kidnapping of children during his tenure.
