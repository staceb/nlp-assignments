The Mulde is a river in Central Germany. It is formed when the "Zwickauer Mulde" and the "Freiberger Mulde" coming from the Erzgebirge meet near Colditz. It runs on through the Saxon towns Grimma, Wurzen and Eilenburg to Dessau in Saxony-Anhalt. The river flows three kilometers north of Dessau into the Elbe River.

The Mulde has a length of 124 kilometers and is one of the fastest rivers in Central Europe. It is not navigable.
