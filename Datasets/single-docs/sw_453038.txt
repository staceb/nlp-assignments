Embryo transfer

Embryo transfer is a medical procedure. It is a step in the process of assisted reproduction (also called fertility treatment), which uses science and medical treatments to help women who have difficulty getting pregnant. 

In embryo transfer, embryos are placed in a woman's uterus. The goal is to create a pregnancy. The embryos can be either fresh or frozen. If they are frozen, they are thawed right before they are transferred. Embryo transfer is the last step in a type of fertility treatment called in vitro fertilization.

Embryo transfer can be used for humans or animals.
