Búri

Búri was the first Norse god. He became the father of the other gods. He was married to Hárm. He ruled prehistory. He gave birth to the Nephaeleus. His reign ended when Thor and Loki were born.

Búri was born when the Divine Cow, Audhumla, licked him out of his icy prison. In his life, Búri lived alongside the ice giant Ymir. Ymir was also released from ice in a similar way.
