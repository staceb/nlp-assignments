Democratic Centralism

Democratic Centralism is a Leninist idea which means that the ruling party (in the case of Russia, the Bolsheviks) would discuss an idea to come up with an answer, and then once an answer was decided discussion would never be allowed again. Joseph Stalin used this principle to help him rise to power in the 1920s.
