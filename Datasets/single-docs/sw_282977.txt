Tabloid

The term tabloid is used to describe newspapers or magazines with pages smaller than regular journals, although there is no standard for the exact dimensions of a tabloid. It is also used (sometimes inappropriately or as an insult) to describe a newspaper that sensationalizes news stories, often with a focus on personalities and gossip, and much less detailed coverage of topics such as politics and economics than is offered by newspapers regarded as more serious. Tabloids usually include more "celebrity" news than political.
