Procter &amp; Gamble

Procter & Gamble (P&G) is an American corporation. The company is in downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. It was founded in 1837 by William Procter and James Gamble. It mostly has a wide range of cleaning products and hygienic products.

Before selling Pringles to Kellogg's, P&G's products also included food and drink.

Products produced by P&G include Crest, Ivory soaps, Tide laundry detergent and Prell shampoo. In the 1880s, they created Ivory soap, a product that floats in water.

In January 2005, P&G announced they were buying Gillette, a company known for making razors and razor blades for shaving. P&G used to make Duracell batteries. The company makes Braun products and Oral-B toothbrushes.

P&G got out of the food business in 2012 when they sold Pringles to the Kellogg's food company. P&G had also sold Jif peanut butter, Crisco shortening and Folgers' coffee.

Procter and Gamble produced and sponsored the first serial dramas during the 1930s. Because of P&G being known for detergents, these serial dramas started being called soap operas. With television in the 1950s and 1960s, soap operas, such as "Guiding Light", went from the radio to CBS television. The last P&G produced show, "As the World Turns", left television in 2010. The only soap opera partially produced by P&G remaining on air is "The Young and the Restless" on CBS. From May 1964 to June 1999, P&G produced and sponsored "Another World" on the NBC network.
