Bog turtle

The bog turtle ("Glyptemys muhlenbergii") is a turtle found only in the eastern United States (northeast and Appalachian Mountains). It is the smallest North American turtle. It measures about long when fully grown. Bog turtles are threatened from loss of habitat and collection as pets. 

It looks similar to the painted or spotted turtles. But it is more closely related to the larger wood turtle. The bog turtle is identified by the yellow or orange spot on each side of its head and neck.

The bog turtle lives in bogs and other wetlands. They are a rare and endangered species. It mostly eats insects and their larva. It is unknown how long they live in the wild. In captivity they live up to 30 years.
