Varg Vikernes

Varg Vikernes (legal name Louis Cachet, born Kristian Vikernes on February 11, 1973 near Bergen, Norway) is a black metal musician, convicted murderer, arsonist and political activist. In 1991 Vikernes created the one-man music project Burzum. Burzum quickly became important within the early Norwegian black metal scene. Later he became a part of the Heathen Front and wrote several writings on Germanic neopaganism. In a documentary on heavy metal, he was described as "the most notorious metal musician of all time."

In the early 1990s, there were black metal bands who believed in burning churches to prove their hatred for Christianity. Vikernes was found guilty of arson and the murder of Mayhem band member Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth. He was sent to prison for 21 years. Vikernes was up for parole in 2008 but it was denied. He was released in March 2009.

On July 16th 2013, Vikernes and his wife, a French national, were arrested in Corrèze, France, on suspicion of planning acts of terrorism because his wife had purchased four rifles. They were released with no charges after police could not identify any terrorist plans or targets.
