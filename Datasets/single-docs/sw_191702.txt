Boeremusiek

Every artist or band comes up with their own sound and style. They make up their own style by playing different types of concertinas and using different instruments in the band. 

A concertina is similar to an accordion and is the lead instrument in most Boeremusiek bands. There are many different types of concertinas, which is why Boeremusiek has so many sounds and styles, and the construction the concertina is what makes the different sounds in the Boeremusiek band; it depends on where the slots and holes are put makes the difference on the sound that the concertina makes. 

Other instruments that might be in a Boeremusiek band are piano accordions, button harmonicas, accordions, pianos, harmoniums and the guitar. Sometimes, a cello or bass guitar may be seen.
