Norm of the North is a 2016 3D American-Indian computer-animated comedy movie. It was produced by Crest Animation Studios. It was distributed by Lions Gate Entertainment. The movie was written by the Altiere brothers. It was directed by Anthony Bell (co-director of "Alpha and Omega"). It stars Rob Schneider, Ken Jeong and Zachary Gordon.

Steven and Daniel Altiere's script (based on a story by director Anthony Bell) centers on Norm, a Polar Bear who finds shelter in an abandoned research station when his Arctic home begins cracking and collapsing beneath him. He is accompanied by three Arctic Lemmings, sidekicks who instinctively copy Norm's every move. As the polar ice caps continue mysteriously breaking apart, their temporary home is abruptly dislodged, setting Norm and the lemmings on a journey that ends in NYC. Here Norm is discovered by the head of a multinational company and becomes their mascot. 
Suddenly Norm is living his performing dream as a dancing star. Unfortunately, he also soon learns the polar ice caps are continuing to break apart, and the people that made his dream come true are responsible. Norm knows he must stop them before they destroy his home, a realization that forces him to choose between life in the spotlight and his entire Polar Bear community.
