Chronos

Chronos (Ancient Greek: , "time", also written as Khronos or Chronus) is the Greek God of time. He is the personification of time in philosophy before Socrates, and in later literature. Chronos controls the past, present, and future of everything. Without Chronos, the other Greek Gods would have never existed.

In the Orphic cosmogony, Chronos never ages. He gives birth to Aether and Chaos, and made a silvery egg in the divine Aether. It produced the god Phanes, who is a hermaphrodite. Phanes gave birth to the first generation of gods and is the creator of the cosmos.
