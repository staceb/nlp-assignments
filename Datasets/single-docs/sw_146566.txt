Westward Ho!

Westward Ho! is a village on the north coast of Devon, England, UK. It is the only place in the British Isles to have an exclamation mark (!) in its name. The name comes from the novel of the same name by Charles Kingsley.

Another example of a place name with a exclamation mark in its name is Saint-Louis-du-Ha! Ha!, Quebec (Canada). But these are colloquial, unlike Westward Ho!'s.
