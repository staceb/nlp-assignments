New Zealand national football team

The New Zealand national football team is the national football team of New Zealand. They are commonly known as the All Whites. In New Zealand, football is often called soccer in spoken English. 

In the 2010 FIFA world cup, the All whites played in group F, along with Italy, Paraguay and Slovakia. 
The All Whites played Slovakia to start off with and drew 1-1. The All Whites then played Italy, and surprisingly also drew 1-1, taking all of New Zealand by surprise. NZ then played Paraguay as the deciding match, in this game, Paraguay and New Zealand drew 0-0. This is the first world cup where New Zealand has scored a goal and the first world cup where NZ is undefeated.
The All whites have so much help by the fans, Ricki Herbert and Neil Emblen so I would like to celebrate them for all they have done and support.
