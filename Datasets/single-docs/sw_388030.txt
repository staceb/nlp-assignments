Piano Concerto No. 5 (Beethoven)

The Piano Concerto No. 5 in E flat major ("Emperor"), Op. 73 is a piece of music for piano and orchestra by Ludwig van Beethoven. It was written in 1809, and was first performed in Leipzig in November 1811. It is the last of Beethoven's concertos.

Beethoven's growing deafness made it impossible for him to play the first performance. It was played by Friedrich Schneider. The work is written on a grand scale with themes that are martial at times, and at other times intimate and personal.
