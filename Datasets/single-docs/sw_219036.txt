Feather Falls

Feather Falls is a waterfall found on the Fall River. It is a tributary of the Middle Fork Feather River, in Plumas National Forest of Butte County, California. The falls were often said to be over 640 feet tall, however, they recently measured to stand 410 feet tall, which is what the USGS Brush Creek 7 1/2" quadrangle says. A town found nearby, Feather Falls, California, is named after this waterfall.
