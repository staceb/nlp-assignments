Voltage regulator

Voltage regulator is an elecrical component that maintains a constant voltage level. It stabilizes the voltage. For example, when a voltage regulator is fed a voltage that varies betveen 7.5 - 9.0 Volts, the regulator's output stays at exactly 5 Volts. Another way to stabilize voltage is by using a zener diode.
