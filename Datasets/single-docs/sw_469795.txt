The Super Mario Challenge

The Super Mario Challenge was a show that aired on The Children's Channel. It last from September to December 20, 1991, and aired every day 4:30 PM, except for weekends.

The person who presented the show was John Lenahan. He was dressed and looked like Mario. Two players had to do jobs that called for playing the "Mario" video games "Super Mario Bros.", "Super Mario Bros. 2", and "Super Mario Bros. 3". Rounds are made up of tests to see who could end a level in the fastest time. The other object of the game was to see which contestant gets the most coins on a certain level. Winners of each round would get one to three "gold coins." Then whoever holds the most at the end of the show would move forward to the next stage of the competition. If both players had an equal number of gold coins, a single-level sudden death playoff decided who would go through.

The show was dropped in 1991, quite a while before The Children's Channel changed to TCC. Link Anchor Man got many letters asking if the show would be done again, it never was.
