Carlit

Pic Carlit (; ) is a mountain of the French Pyrenees and has an elevation of above sea level.

It is the highest point of the department of Pyrénées-Orientales and of the region Languedoc-Roussillon, France.

Pic Carlit is in the nortwestern part of the Regional Natural Park of the Catalan Pyrenees (; , often shortened as "Parc del Pirineu Català").

There are many small lakes in the region around the mountain. One of them is the man-made lake of Bouillouses, which is one of the point to begin hiking to get to the top of Pic Carlit.

The source of Têt (the largest river of the department Pyrénées-Orientales) is on the northeastern side of the mountain.

The first ascent of this peak was made by Henry Russell in 1864.
