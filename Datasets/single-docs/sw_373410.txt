Sardar

Sardar or Sirdar or Serdar, is a title of nobility in India, Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan. 

The word is from the old Sanskrit and Avesta languages. It means a prince, nobleman, tribal chief or leader or other aristocrat. In some tribes and ethnic groups in India and Pakistan, especially among the Baloch people and Punjabis, it is quite commonly used to denote even certain families of noble origins.
