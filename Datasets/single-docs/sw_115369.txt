Seattle Mariners

The Seattle Mariners are an American Major League Baseball team based in Seattle, Washington. The Mariners are part of the Western Division of Major League Baseball's American League. Since July 1999, their home stadium has been Safeco Field. Until they moved in June 1999, the club's home park was the Kingdome.

Seattle had minor league baseball teams from the early 1900s to the late 1960s, with nicknames such as the "Indians" and the "Rainiers".

The first major league baseball franchise in Seattle was the Seattle Pilots, formed in 1969. The Pilots moved to Milwaukee the next year and became the Milwaukee Brewers. As a result, the city of Seattle, King County, and the state of Washington sued the American League for $32 million dollars in damages. In exchange for dropping the law suit, the American League gave Seattle a Major League Baseball team in 1977.

Seattle is a large and important seaport, a fact which led to the major league teams being called the "Pilots" and the "Mariners".

The Mariner's first winning season was in 1991, and the first time they made the playoffs was in 1995. The Mariners are owned by Nintendo of America, and the general manager of the team is Jack Zduriencik.
