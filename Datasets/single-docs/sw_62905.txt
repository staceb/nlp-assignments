Band Aid (band)

Band Aid was a British and Irish charity music supergroup. It was started in 1984 by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure. The purpose was to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia by making the record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" The single was very successful. It was Number One on the music charts during Christmas. Two re-recordings of the song were done. They raised more money and also finished Number One on the charts.

Band Aid II re-recorded the song in 1989, and Band Aid 20 did the same in 2004.
