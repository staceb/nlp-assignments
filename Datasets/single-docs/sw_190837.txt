Farrah Fawcett

Farrah Fawcett (February 2, 1947 – June 25, 2009) was an American actress. A multiple Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominee, Fawcett rose to international fame when she first appeared as private investigator Jill Munroe in the TV series "Charlie's Angels" in 1976. Fawcett later appeared off-Broadway to the approval of critics and in highly rated television movies in roles often challenging ("The Burning Bed", "Nazi Hunter: The Beate Klarsfeld Story", "", "Margaret Bourke-White") and sometimes unsympathetic ("Small Sacrifices"). Farrah played Marjorie in the movie named Extremities (where Marjorie got abused by the abusive man).

Fawcett was a pop culture figure whose hairstyle was emulated by millions of young women and whose poster sales broke records, making her an international sex symbol in the 1970s and 1980s. While her impact was particularly strong on the teens of the 1970s, her appeal spreads over multiple generations. 

Fawcett married Lee Majors in 1973. They couple separated in 1979 and divorced in 1982. She had a relationship with Ryan O'Neal from 1979 until 1997. She had a relationship with movie producer James Orr, who deliberately injured her, for which he was convicted of assault. In 2001, she resumed her relationship with O'Neal. Fawcett's son Redmond O'Neal was born in January 1985. She died of anal cancer aged 62 in June 2009.
