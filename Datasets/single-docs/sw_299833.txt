Melodica

The melodica, also known as the "blow-organ" or "key-flute", is a wind instrument with a keyboard on top, and is played by blowing air through a mouthpiece that fits into a hole in the side of the instrument. The keyboard is usually two or three octaves long. Melodicas are small, light, and portable. They are popular in music education, especially in Asia.
