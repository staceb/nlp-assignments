Fernando de Herrera

Fernando de Herrera (~1534–1597) called "El Divino" was a 16th-century Spanish poet and man of letters. He was born in Seville. Much of what is known about him comes from the book "Libro de descripción de verdaderos retratos de illustres y memorables varones" (Book of the Description of the True Portraits of Illustrious and Memorable Men), which was written in 1599 by Francisco Pacheco.
