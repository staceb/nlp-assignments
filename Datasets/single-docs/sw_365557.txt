Nervesa della Battaglia

Nervesa della Battaglia is a "comune" (municipality) in the Province of Treviso in the Italian region Veneto, located about 45 km north of Venice and about 20 km north of Treviso. 

Sites include the remains of the Abbey of Sant'Eustachio, near the Piave river, which reached its apex in the 13th century. It was abandoned in 1865, and heavily damaged during the Battle of the Piave River in World War I. Another disappeared convent is the Charterhouse of San Girolamo, located on the Montello hill.
