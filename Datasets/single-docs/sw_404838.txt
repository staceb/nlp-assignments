Chumash (Judaism)

The Hebrew term Chumash (also Ḥumash, ) is a term for "Torah" in printed form, unlike the Torah scroll.

The word comes from the Hebrew word for five, "" (). A more formal term is "Ḥamishah Ḥumshei Torah", meaning "five fifths of Torah". It is a Hebrew name for the Five Books of Moses, also known by the Latinised Greek term Pentateuch in common printed editions. The five books are: Moses, Beraishis (Genesis), Shemot (Exodus), Vayikra (Leviticus), Bamidbar (Numbers), and Devarim (Deuteronomy).
