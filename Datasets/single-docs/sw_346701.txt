Great Britain Olympic football team

The Great Britain Olympic football team (also known as Team GB) represents the United Kingdom in international football competitions at the Olympic Games. The selection is currently limited to players under the age of 23.

In 1974 the difference between amateur and professional players was found therefore the Team GB Football team was disbanded.

The Olympic football team has been reformed, again run by the FA, for the 2012 Olympic Games, which are to be hosted in London. The team's coach is Stuart Pearce who will be allowed to select players from across the UK.The SFA are worried that if Team GB field a team in the Olympics Great Britain will field a team in other international competitions.
