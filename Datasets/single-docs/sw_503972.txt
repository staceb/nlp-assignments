Truncated icosahedron

A truncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid. A regular icosahedron is made of 20 faces. When a regular icosahedron is truncated, this means that each "corner" (or vertex) is replaced by a pentagon, as there are five edges at each corner. 

A truncated icosahedron is made of 12 regular pentagons and 20 hexagons. It has 60 vertices, and 90 edges. 

The molecule Fullerene is made of 60 carbon atoms and looks like a truncated icosahedron. 

Most soccer balls are truncated icosahedra.
