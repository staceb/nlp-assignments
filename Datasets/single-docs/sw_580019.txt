His Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, debut came in 1965, with first appearances at the Metropolitan Opera, New York City, and La Scala, Milan, also coming in the same decade. He worked with Maria Callas on a number of occasions, and made recordings of "Carmen" and "Tosca" with her.

Prêtre died in his home in Navès (Tarn), near Castres on 4 January 2017, aged 92.
