Nancy (comics)

Nancy is a daily comic strip originally written and drawn by Ernie Bushmiller. Nancy is a pudgy little girl whose friends include poor boy Sluggo, rich kid Rollo, bully and troublemaker Spike, girlfriend Irma, and a dog named Poochie. 

Nancy lives with her unmarried aunt, Fritzi Ritz. Nancy made her first appearance in her aunt's strip on January 2, 1933, but broke away in 1938 to star in her own. When Bushmiller died in August 1982, the strip was continued by other writers and artists.
