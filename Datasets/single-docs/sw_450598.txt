Chico Marx

Leonard "Chico" Marx (March 22, 1887 – October 11, 1961) was an American comedian and movie star. He was one of the five Marx Brothers. In the movies, Chico talked with a pretend Italian accent and played the piano. He flirted with the ladies and wore a curly wig. In most of the movies, he got into trouble by playing pranks with his brother, Harpo.

Chico was a good pianist. As a child, he started playing with only his right hand and fake playing with his left. Chico finally learned to play the piano very well. But to be funny, he was famous for “shooting” the keys of the piano. He would play the notes with his thumb up and index finger straight; like a gun.

Chico Marx was born in New York City. His father was born in France and worked as a tailor and his mother was from Germany. He was married twice. In 1917, he married Betty Karp. They had a daughter named Maxine. He taught her to be an actress. After a divorce, he later married Mary De Vithas. They married in 1958, three years before his death. Chico died at home of arteriosclerosis, on October 11, 1961, in Hollywood. He was the oldest brother and the first to die. He is in a mausoleum in Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.
