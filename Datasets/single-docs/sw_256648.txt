Avant Browser

Avant Browser is a free web browser created by a Chinese programmer called Anderson Che.

The Avant browser follows a set of commands that are similar to those of Internet Explorer (known as the Trident layout engine), but has more features and is more customisable. 

Avant can only work on Windows computers that have Internet Explorer (6, 7 or 8) installed on them.

The browser is available in 41 languages. As of November 2008, there were over 22 million downloads.
