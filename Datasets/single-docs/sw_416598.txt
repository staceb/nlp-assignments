Virtual learning environment

A virtual learning environment (VLE) is a kind of e-learning system placed on a website. It gives learners online access to tools and information to help them with learning something.

Common tools offered on a VLE are: online quizzes, email, discussion forums and student blogs. Common information shared with learners via a VLE is: worksheets, lesson plans, homework, grades, assignments and deadlines.

Combining the use of a VLE and normal classes is often called blended learning.

Some well-known VLEs are Moodle, WebCT and BlackBoard, but many others exist.
