Outer Banks

The Outer Banks are a line of barrier islands off the east coast of North Carolina. The islands form a 200 mile long stretch. The islands are narrow. The islands are supported by tourism. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and the Pamlico Sound is to the west. In the 1580s, the Lost Colony was built on the Outer Banks. The Wright Brothers's first flight happened on the Outer Banks in 1903.
