Abigail Adams

Abigail Smith Adams (November 11, 1744–October 28, 1818) was the wife of John Adams, the second President of the United States. Later on, people started to address the wife of the president as the First Lady. So, she became the second First Lady of the United States. She was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts. She belonged to a famous family of Massachusetts (the Quincy Family). 

Adams did not get any formal education in any school or college. Her father had a big library, so she studied a number of books and became knowledgeable. She married John Adams in 1764. In the next ten years, she had five children (a sixth was stillborn), including John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. 

In 1801, the couple retired and lived in Quincy. Abigail died in 1818, at age 74 of typhoid fever.
