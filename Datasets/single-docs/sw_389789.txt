Module (mathematics)

In abstract algebra, a module is the generalization of a vector space. Modules are defined with respect to a ring. A vector space uses vectors and scalars, it defines the operations of additions and multiplication of these two. 

Modules also generalize the idea of abelian group. Abelian groups are modules over the ring of integers.
