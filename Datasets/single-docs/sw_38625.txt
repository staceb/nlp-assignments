Penalty kick

A penalty kick (short pen) is a type of free kick in football. The ball is 11 meters away from the goal post. A penalty kick is taken by the team which has been fouled if the violent act is made in the penalty box. 
Penalties can also happen in a penalty shootout, when there is a draw in a match even after added extra time.
