Boxxy

Catherine "Catie" Wayne (born April 28, 1992), better known by her online name, Boxxy, is an American internet celebrity. She is known for her highly-energetic tone in her blogging videos. She rose to fame in late 2008 and early 2009 when she made videos anonymously under the name "Boxxy" and posted them to her Gaia Online profile. They were later posted onto the website iambored.com and spread to the website 4chan. This resulted in a large online following. She later became an Internet meme. She is known to wear heavy eyeliner and ramble excitedly about many different things while displaying "ridiculous" and possibly "fake" personality quirks. She is rated by the AOL channel's "urlesque" as #104 on its list of ""The 100 Most Iconic Internet Videos"". She was also mentioned in a Fox News report on Internet trolls.
