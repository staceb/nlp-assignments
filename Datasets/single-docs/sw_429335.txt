Battle of Gemmano

The Battle of Gemmano was a battle fought between the German and Allied forces in World War II. It was part of the Allies' Operation Olive, the attack in August 1944 on the Gothic Line. This was the German line of defence in the Apennines in northern Italy.

It consisted of a series of four British attacks between 4 September to 15 September 1944. The British attacked the German defences in and around the village of Gemmano. The village was captured on 9 September during the second attack.

Two more attacks were required to capture the surrounding area. Fighting was heavy. The Battle of Gemmano has been called the "Cassino of the Adriatic" by some historians.
