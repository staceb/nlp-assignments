The club was founded as SG Aue in 1945 and on 1 November 1948 became BSG Pneumatik Aue.

In 1954 the government decided that the nearby city Chemnitz(now called Karl-Marx-Stadt) should have a good team. So the name of Aue was changed to SC Wismut Karl Marx Stadt. But the club still played in Aue. In 1963 Karl Marx Stadt got its own team so the club was renamed to SC Wismut Aue.
