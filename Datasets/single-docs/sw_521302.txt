Tom Graveney

Thomas William "Tom" Graveney OBE (16 June 1927 – 3 November 2015) was a leading English cricketer. He represented his country in 79 Test matches and scoring over 4,800 runs. In a career lasting from 1948 to 1972, he was the 15th person to score one hundred first-class centuries, and the first post-war player to do so. 

Graveney was born in Riding Mill, Hexham, Northumberland on 16 June 1927. His brother was Ken Graveney, also a cricketer. Graveney studied at the Bristol Grammar School.

He played for Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, and helped Worcestershire win the county championship for the first time in their history. His achievements for England after being recalled in 1966 have been described as "the stuff of legend." Graveney was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1953, captained England on one occasion and was awarded the OBE while still playing.

In later life he worked as a cricket commentator for BBC Television and was the first former professional to be President of the Marylebone Cricket Club. He was one of the first 55 players inducted to the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame in 2009.

Graveney was married to Jackie Graveney from 1952 until her death of Alzheimer's disease in 2013. Graveney's brother, Ken, died on 25 October 2015. A week after his brother's death, Graveney died on 3 November 2015 from Parkinson's disease at the age of 88.
