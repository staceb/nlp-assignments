Polymer clay

Polymer clay is a type of modelling clay made from the polymer polyvinyl chloride (PVC). It usually does not contain any clay minerals, but the way it is made has given it the colloquial name of clay. A liquid is added to dry particles until it has gel-like working properties, and the part is put into an oven to harden. Polymer clay is generally used for making arts and craft items. There are many different brands of polymer clay.
