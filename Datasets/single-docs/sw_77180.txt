Étang Saumâtre

Étang Saumâtre (in English, "brackish pond") is the largest lake of Haiti. It is the second largest lake of Hispaniola, after Lake Enriquillo. It is also known as Lake Azuei. It is known as "Lago del Fondo" in the Dominican Republic. Its Taíno name was "Yainagua".

The lake is on the arid part of the Plain of the Cul-de-Sac. It is east of Port-au-Prince in the Ouest Department. Its eastern side is part of the border between Haiti and the Dominican Republic; the Dominican city of Jimaní is at less than 1 km from the southeast end of the lake.

The water of the lake is dark blue. Its salinity is about one fifth (1/5) the salinity of sea water. Very few small rivers flow into the lake.

Many water birds visit the lake to feed, including flamingos. There are also American crocodiles and some fishes including tilapia. Because it is an arid region, the vegetation around the lake is poor with cacti and small shrubs.
