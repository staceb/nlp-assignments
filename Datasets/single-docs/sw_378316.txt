Bagh-e-Jinnah

Bagh-e-Jinnah (used to be called Lawrence Gardens) is a large park in Lahore, Pakistan. It includes a botanical garden and other popular facilities, which were made during the British Raj. The Gardens were originally named after Sir John Lawrence, who was the first Lieutenant-Governor of the Punjab and who did much to develop the city of Lahore in colonial times. 

After Pakistan's independence, some people demanded that the Gardens be renamed with a more 'patriotic' name so during the 1980s, their name was finally changed to "Bagh i Jinnah" (Jinnah's Gardens), after Muhammad Ali Jinnah, founder of the country. However, many people in Lahore still continue to call the Gardens as 'Lawrence Gardens', for the sake of historical accuracy.
