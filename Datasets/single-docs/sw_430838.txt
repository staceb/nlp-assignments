Tachikawa Ki-54

The Tachikawa Ki-54 was a trainer aircraft used by the Imperial Japanese Army. It was called "Hickory" by the Allies for it's codename.

The aircraft was made because of a requirement by Imperial Japanese Army that they needed a twin-engine advanced trainer for training the crew. There is a Ki-54 fuselage in the storage at the Australian War Museum Annex.
