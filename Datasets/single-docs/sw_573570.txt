Hôtel de Montesson

The Hôtel de Montesson was a small townhouse on the Rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin in Paris, France. It was constructed after 1770 for Madame de Montesson, the secret and morganatic wife of Louis Philippe d'Orléans, Duke of Orléans. He had a house adjoined to Montesson's. The couple would eventually marry circa 1768 in the Chapel of the "Hôtel". The building would be destroyed by an accidental fire in 1810.
