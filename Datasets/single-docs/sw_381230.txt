Passiflora

Passiflora is also known as the passion flowers or passion vines. It is a genus of about 500 species of flowering plants. They are mainly vines, with some being shrubs, and a few species being herbaceous. See passionfruit for information about the fruit of the passiflora plant.

The family "Passifloraceae" is characterized by a pantropical distribution. "Passiflora" is absent from Africa, which, instead, hosts many other members of its family (e.g. the more plesiomorphic "Adenia").

There are nine species of "Passiflora" native to the USA, from Ohio to the north, west to California and south to the Florida Keys. Most other species are found in South America, China, and Southern Asia, New Guinea, four or more species in Australia and an endemic species in New Zealand.
