The Sir Christopher Wren Building is both the oldest college building in the United States and a National Historic Landmark. The building, nicknamed just the "Wren Building", got its new name in 1931 to honor the English architect Sir Christopher Wren. The first building, in 1699, was designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Not much is known about how the first building looked. It burned down within a few years of its completion.
