Palais Bourbon

The Palais Bourbon is a large building in Paris. It is on the left bank of the River Seine. Today it is the home of the French National Assembly. It was originally built by Louise Françoise de Bourbon as a large townhouse for her own personal use. It was later the main Parisian residence of the Princes of Condé. 

Building began in 1722 under the direction of several prominent architects of the day. It was inspired by the "Grand Trianon" in the grounds of the Palace of Versailles. It was built near the "Hôtel de Lassay", which was the townhouse of the Marquis of Lassay. He was a nobleman the duchess had began having an affair with some years prior. The two buildings were connected by a corridor. 

During the French Revolution the property was seized as a "bien national" or property of the nation.
