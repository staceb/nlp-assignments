Religious order

A religious order is a group of people who live in some way set apart from others, in accordance with their specific religious devotion. Their principles are usually created from their founder's religious practice. The order may comprise initiates (laity) and, in some traditions, ordained clergy. Religious orders exist in many of the world's religions. Many orders operate monasteries.
