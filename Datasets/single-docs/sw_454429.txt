Gendarmerie Nationale

In France, the National Gendarmerie is one of the divisions of the French Armed Forces, the military police. They are responsible for the public safety. They act like police for the citizens of France. It also contains a military police force and a special forces component, the GIGN. In 2011 more than 98,155 people were working for the National Gendarmerie in France.

The Gendarmerie works together with the other national law enforcement agency, the Police Nationale. And since 2009, even though this force is a part of the armed forces establishment, it belonged to the Ministry of the Interior as its military component and it is part of its operations and the budget. They fulfill national security duties and duties in support of their ministry. 

They are also responsible for road patrols. The police can stop drivers. When they do so, it is called a contrôle. They can ask for a driver's identification papers and car papers at any time. 

Their weapon quote is Gendarmerie, une force humaine. This literally means "Gendarmerie, a human armed force."

The name "Gendarmerie" comes from "gens d’arme," which means "armed people." This military corp has an exploding grenade as its logo. Instead of metal medals, Gendarmes wear ribbons. These are called bâtons. They get ribbons, inter alia, for service abroad. 

Since a few years ago, the Gendarmes' flat hat, called a képi, has only been used for special occasions. 

The French did not have a uniform until the late 17th century, though some companies had recognizable coat colors. Light grey was common, but red and blue were also worn. It was said that the French in the 17th century had an addiction to bows, ribbons, and plumes, which was suitable to the future leaders of European fashion. Guard Gendarmes probably had red coats. Many guard troops wore the royal badge on their back and their breast. In the 16th century, national signs were that they wore a white cross on their back and on their breast. In the 17th century this became a white sash. 

Nowadays the Gendarmerie uses bulletproof and tactical vests and body armour. A anti-riot shield is used during a heavier riot. They also make use of the spectra helmet. This spectra helmet is fitted with a visor for extra protection of the face. If a tear gas is used, the operators use a special gas mask, which protects them from the dangerous gasses. They also have apparatus for throwing tear gas canisters and FAMAS riffles. This is a sort of weapon. This equipment helps protect Gendarmes while they are doing their jobs.

This is the territorial police branch of the Gendarmerie. It is the branch that is most similar to France’s common police. It has regular contact with France’s population and does jobs similar to the Police of France. The Departmental Gendarmerie is divided into Brigades consisting of 6 to 40 operators. A brigade performs observation and may give assistance to citizens in regulated periods, during both daytime and nighttime.

The Mobile Gendarmerie has several tasks, which include riot control, security of significant places (like embassies), conducting OPEX (External Operations), and providing support to the Departmental Gendarmerie. It is divided into 25 legions, including one advanced armoured anti-riot police group. The Mobile Gendarmerie has control over the GIGN, the counter-terrorism part of the Gendarmerie Nationale.

The GIGN members are well trained to conduct special operations such as hostage rescue. They are also trained in maritime anti-terrorism operations. They are trained to conduct operations with no risk to the public and the hostages. 
A ceremonial unit that takes part in parades and secures important locations in a formal way.

Supervised by the Gendarmerie and the French Navy, the Maritime Gendarmerie conducts maritime surveillance, assistance and rescue at sea; police security at naval bases; and police at sea. They do these jobs not only in France, but also in other countries like French Guiana, Guadeloupe, and others.

The air transport gendarmerie is similar to the Gendarmerie de L’air. The Gendarmerie de L’air conducts safety operations in air force bases and goes to accidents involving military aircraft. Its missions include securing civilian airports, surveillance of technical things in the airport (like control towers), traffic control on the roads near airports, and making sure that important visitors are safe and well protected at airports.
