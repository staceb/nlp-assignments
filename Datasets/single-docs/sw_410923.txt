Flower pot

A flower pot is a container in which flowers and other plants are grown. They are traditionally made from terracotta, but are now often also made from plastic, wood or stone. The flower pot is filled with soil and have a plant planted in them. Often there are holes in the bottom, to allow water to flow out, sometimes into a saucer that is placed under the flowerpot. If the plant becomes too big for the pot, it is moved to a bigger one.
