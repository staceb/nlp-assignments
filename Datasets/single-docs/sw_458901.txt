Timothy McCarthy

Timothy J. McCarthy (born June 20, 1949) is an American police officer. He is the current police chief of Orland Park, Illinois, and a former member of the United States Secret Service. During the 1981 Reagan assassination attempt, he turned into the line of fire, shielding Ronald Reagan from one of John Hinckley, Jr.'s .22 caliber bullets.

Surgeons at George Washington University Hospital successfully removed the round from McCarthy's abdomen, and he fully recovered. McCarthy is one of only four Secret Service agents to have taken a bullet for the President. He received the NCAA Award of Valor in 1982 in recognition of his bravery.
