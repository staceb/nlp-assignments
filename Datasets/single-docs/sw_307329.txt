Batting average

Batting average is a statistic that is used in cricket and baseball measuring the batting of cricket batsmen or baseball hitters. 

In cricket, a batsman's average is the total number of runs he has scored divided by the number of times he has been got out. The statistic can be classified by the level of the cricket. Top batsmen will have separate averages for test cricket, first class cricket, one-day cricket and so on. The highest batting average is by Sir Donald Bradman which is 99.96.

In baseball, the batting average (BA) is defined as the number of hits divided by at bats. For example, if a player had 50 hits over 175 at bats, their batting average would be .286.
