Jagjit Singh

Jagjit Singh (8 February 1941 — 10 October 2011) was an Indian singer. He was known as the "Ghazal King". Ghazal is a classical type of song, dating back to ancient Persia. It uses a special rhyming pattern and the words are written using a special pattern of stanzas. The songs are always about love. Singh, and his wife Chitra Singh who is also a ghazal singer, achieved a lot of commercial success in the 1970's and 1980s. He recorded more than 50 albums.

The ghazal is very popular in Pakistan, and Singh was one of the few Indian singers to become a success in that country. His music was described as "...gentle and soothing, and went to your heart." Ghazal was once a classical, elite type of music and poetry. Singh was able to make ghazal popular by singing in many different languages, singing ghazal in movies and music videos. He used modern technology and was the first ghazal singer to use multi-tracking.

He died in Mumbai, after a stroke in 2011.
