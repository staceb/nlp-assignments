British Rail Class D3/12

British Rail class D3/12 was a class of three diesel electric shunting trains built by the Southern Railway in 1937. They were numbered 1 to 3 in a separate list from the SR's steam-powered trains. They were later renumbered by British Railways 15201–15203. Later, twenty-six similar trains were built after nationalisation as British Rail Class 12.
