Mole cricket

The mole crickets are the family Gryllotalpidae, of broad insects about 3–5 cm (1-2 inches) long, with large eyes and shovel-like forelimbs for burrowing and swimming.

Mole crickets are omnivores or meat eaters, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses. Common predators of mole crickets include birds, rats, skunks, armadillos, raccoons and foxes.
