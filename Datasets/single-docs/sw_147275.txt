In My Place

"In My Place" was released August 2002. The single was released off the hit album "A Rush of Blood to the Head"" released by rock band Coldplay in 2002. "In My Place" was well received by critics. The song was praised for its music and the deep meaning of its words. "In My Place" won Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 45th Grammy Awards. The music video was nominated for two MuchMusic Video Awards in 2003 in the categories of Best international video–group and People's Choice: Favorite international group. It begins with one crash of a cymbal. After that, there are two bars of 4/4 drumming, then a sad three-note guitar line, and Chris Martin's singing.
