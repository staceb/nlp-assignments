Vasco Núñez de Balboa

Vasco Núñez de Balboa (1475–1519) was a Spanish explorer and conquistador. He was the first European to see the Pacific Ocean. Balboa was one of those who established the settlement at Darién in what is now Panama. He was elected mayor, then governor. In 1513, he claimed the Pacific Ocean and all of its shores for Spain. He was searching for gold at the time. In Darién, he had been replaced by a new governor, Pedro Arias Dávila. On orders from Spain, Dávila was to investigate Balboa. On Balboa's return to Darién in 1519, Dávila had him placed on trial, then executed for treason.
