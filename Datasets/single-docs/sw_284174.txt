Andromeda (constellation)

Andromeda is a constellation in the northern sky. It is named after the princess Andromeda in Greek mythology. It is sometimes called "the Chained Lady" or "the Chained Woman" in English. It has also been called "Persea" ("Perseus's wife") or "Cepheis" ("Cepheus's daughter"). The astronomer named Ptolemy listed Andromeda when he made a list of 48 constellations. It is also one of the 88 constellations made by the International Astronomical Union.

The Andromeda Galaxy is inside Andromeda, so it has the same name. It is the closest spiral galaxy to Earth. The brightest star in Andromeda is called Alpha Andromedae, which is a binary star.
