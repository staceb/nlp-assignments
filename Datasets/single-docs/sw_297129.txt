The Edge of Glory

"The Edge of Glory" is a song by American pop singer Lady Gaga from her third album "Born This Way". It was released as the third single from the album on May 17, 2011.

The song peaked at number 3 in the US and Canada, number 2 in Australia, and number 6 in the UK. The RIAA certified the song triple-Platinum on February 29, 2016, for sales and shipments of 3 million copies in the United States alone.

Gaga is shown on a fire escape of an apartment building in New York City. Clarence Clemons, who played the saxophone for American singer Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band, is seen playing the instrument throughout the video. Shortly after appearing in the video, Clemons died from a stroke.

The video was supposed to show Gaga under the sea but was canceled due to creative disagreements.
