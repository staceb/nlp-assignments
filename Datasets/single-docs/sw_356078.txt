La Vita Nuova

La Vita Nuova or Vita Nova (in English: "The New Life") is a book written by Dante Alighieri in 1295. It is an expression of the medieval courtly love and it is written in a "prosimetrum" style, a combination of both prose and verse. It tells the story of his love for Beatrice Portinari, who also served as the ultimate symbol of salvation in "The Divine Comedy".
