The Egyptian Theatre

The Egyptian Theatre, also known as the Ada Theater, at 700 West Main Street in Boise, Idaho is a movie theater that opened in 1927.

The Egyptian Theatre is surrounded by Boise history that makes this building a tour of Boise history.

It was first opened in 1927. The building was built in the model of the newly discovered King Tut's tomb. Over time it was changed repeatedly. In 1999 it was remodeled once again after the original building. 

Now, it mainly runs movies and concerts.

The theater is architecturally significant as one of the few surviving theaters from the grand cinema and movie palace era in Boise.

The Bourne Identity, The Bourne Supremacy, and The Bourne Ultimatum, starring Matt Damon, premieres were all hosted at The Egyptian Theatre. 

It is also said to be one of the more haunted buildings in Boise, and was featured on the Travel Channel show Ghost Stories in 2009.
