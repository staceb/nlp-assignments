Cashew

The cashew is a tropical tree in the flowering plant. The plant is native to northeastern Brazil. It is now widely grown in tropical climates for its cashew nuts (see below) and cashew apples.

Cashew nuts are a popular snack and food source. Cashews, unlike other oily tree nuts, contain starch to about 10% of their weight. This makes them more effective than other nuts in thickening water-based dishes such as soups, meat stews, and some Indian milk-based desserts. Many southeast Asian and south Asian cuisines use cashews for this unusual characteristic, rather than other nuts.

Because the shell of the cashew nut is toxic, it is removed before it is sold to consumers.
