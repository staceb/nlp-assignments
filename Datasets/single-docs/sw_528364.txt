Baby Got Back

"Baby Got Back" is a 1992 hip hop song by Sir Mix-A-Lot. The song is about larger than normal buttocks. At the time of its release, some found the lyrics objectionable.

At the beginning of the song, two girls are talking. One says: "Oh my God, Becky. Look at her butt!"

The video of the song was banned by MTV for a short time.

The song was #1 on the U.S. "Billboard" Hot 100.

In late January 2013, a preview of the show "Glee" included a cover of "Baby Got Back". Jonathan Coulton claimed "Glee" copied his version of the song.
