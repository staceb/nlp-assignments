Interstate 77

Interstate 77 is an Interstate Highway in the eastern United States. It goes from Columbia, South Carolina north to Cleveland, Ohio. The route is long. It traverses diverse terrain, from the mountainous state of West Virginia to the rolling farmlands of North Carolina and Ohio. It largely supplants the old U.S. Route 21 between Cleveland, Ohio, and Columbia, South Carolina, as an important north–south corridor through the middle Appalachians. The southern terminus of Interstate 77 is in Columbia at the junction with Interstate 26. The northern terminus is in Cleveland at the junction with Interstate 90.

The East River Mountain Tunnel, connecting Virginia and West Virginia, is one of only two instances in the United States where a mountain "road" tunnel crosses a state line. The other is the Cumberland Gap Tunnel, connecting Tennessee and Kentucky.
