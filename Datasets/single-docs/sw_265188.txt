Nickel(II) nitrate

Nickel(II) nitrate, also known as nickelous nitrate, is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is Ni(NO). It contains nickel in its +2 oxidation state. It also contains nitrate ions.

Nickel(II) nitrate is a green crystalline solid. It dissolves in water. Because it has nitrate ions, it is an oxidizing agent. It normally has water molecules attached to it, making it hydrated. 

It is made by dissolving nickel metal in nitric acid.

It is used as a source of nickel(II), but nickel(II) chloride and nickel(II) sulfate are used more commonly.

It is an oxidizing agent, so it should be kept away from things that can burn. It also is toxic to things that live in the water. It is a carcinogen.
