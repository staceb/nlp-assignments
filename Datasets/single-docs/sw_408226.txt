Vadstena

Vadstena is a town in the county of Östergötland in Sweden. It is the seat of Vadstena Municipality.

Back in the Middle Ages, the town housed a Catholic monastery, which was closed in the 16th century, when Sweden turned towards Martin Luther's Protestantism. In the 20th century, the monastery was re-opened.
