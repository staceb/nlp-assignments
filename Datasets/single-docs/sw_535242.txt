Rómulo Macció

Romulo Macció (1931 – 11 March 2016) was an Argentine painter. He worked with the local avant-garde art movement which took shape during the 1960s. He was born in Buenos Aires. 

Macció described much of the genteel portrait and landscape art available at that time as "pink chocolate." He was awarded the De Ridder Prize in 1959 and the Torcuato di Tella Institute International Prize in 1962. He helped create the Neo-figurative movement that swept Latin American art during the 1960s. 

Macció died in Buenos Aires on 11 March 2016. He was aged 84.
