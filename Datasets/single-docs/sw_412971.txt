Montacute, South Australia

Montacute is a small town and suburb in Adelaide Hills, South Australia. The town is on Fifth Creek. It is mostly a rural area. Rostrevor is to the west of the suburb, while Lenswood is to the east, Castambul is to the north, and Norton Summit and Cherryville are to its west. The small town of Montacute Heights is on top of the ridge between Fifth and Sixth Creeks.

Copper was discovered in the area in 1843, and a mine was built soon after. One of the people who gave money for the mine was Sir John Baker. He named the area after Montacute in Somerset, which was close to the place where he was born. Gold was discovered in 1846. The "Victoria Mine" became the first gold deposit to be commercially mined in Australia.

The main industries are now orchards and market gardens. The 200-hectare Montacute Conservation Park was founded in 1971.

Corkscrew Road is a popular route for cyclists and people on day-trips. It is a small road linking Montacute Heights with Gorge Road via a precipitous route with many twists and turns.
