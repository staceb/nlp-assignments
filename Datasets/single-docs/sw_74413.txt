Tynwald

It rules the Isle of Man, and while the island is a Crown dependency, this ancient form of government enjoys a large amount of political power. 

Tynwald is separated into 2 houses (this is called a "Bicameral" parliament, meaning it has 2 chambers) - the House of Keys, which is elected by the people of the Isle of Man, and the Legislative Council, which is not directly elected - instead, other members of the Legislative Council elect members of the House of Keys (MHK's) to sit on it.

Both houses of Tynwald sit at the same time on Tynwald day, at the site of the original parliament - Tynwald Hill - in St. John's, a small village near Peel, and once a month at Parliament House in the Island's capital, Douglas. The rest of the time, they sit separately at Parliament House, with the House of Keys making most of the laws, and the Legislative Council doing most of the work of changing and revising them. 

Queen Elizabeth II is acknowledged as the Lord of Mann.

Tynwald can trace its descent from the Viking and Norse that first colonized the Isle of Man.
