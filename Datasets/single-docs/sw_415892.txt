Japanese occupation of Hong Kong

The Japanese occupation of Hong Kong (Chinese: ) was a time when Japan controlled Hong Kong. It began when the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Young, gave up the British Crown colony of Hong Kong to Empire of Japan on 25 December 1941. The occupation lasted for three years and eight months until Japan gave up at the end of Second World War.

One day after the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong started, the Japanese military yen was changed to the only legal currency of Hong Kong. In January 1942, two Hong Kong dollars could be converted to one Japanese military yen. However, in July, four Hong Kong dollars were needed to be converted to one Japanese military yen.

All primary schools and secondary schools had to teach Japanese. They were not allowed to teach English.
