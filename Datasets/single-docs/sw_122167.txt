Sanctuary

A sanctuary, in its original meaning, is a sacred place, such as a shrine or temple. By the use of such places as a safe haven, the term has come to be used for any place of safety. This secondary use can be a human sanctuary, such as a political sanctuary; and non-human sanctuary, such as an animal or plant sanctuary.
