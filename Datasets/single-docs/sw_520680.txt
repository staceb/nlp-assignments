Fellow traveller

Fellow travellers were supporters of the Soviet Union who were not members of the Communist Party. 

They were a varied group of western intellectuals, writers and bohemians who declared their sympathies for the Soviet Union at the height of Stalinism and into the 1970s of the 20th century.
