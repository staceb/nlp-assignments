Summer park

A summer park is a form of theme park with a summertime theme. A summer park is only opened during the summertime season. Playgrounds and swimming pool make up most attractions instead of carousels.

Several summer parks have been built in Denmark.

The phenomenon was booming in Sweden by the late and mid 1980s. It expanded during the economic boom before a decrease began in the early 1990s during the economc recession. The phenomenon was also decreasing because of the introduction of a wider entertainment market.
