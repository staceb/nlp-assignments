Hylonomus

Hylonomus is an extinct stem tetrapod which lived 312 million years ago (mya) during the Pennsylvanian.
The lack of skull openings behind the eyes makes it difficult to decide whether or not it is a sauropsid. "Westlothiana" is older, but may have been an amphibian, and "Casineria" is rather fragmentary. 

"Hylonomus" was long (including the tail) and probably would have looked rather similar to modern lizards. It had small sharp teeth and likely ate small invertebrates such as millipedes or early insects.

Fossils of "Hylonomus" have been found in the remains of fossilized club moss stumps in Joggins Fossil Cliffs, Nova Scotia, Canada. The theory is that, after harsh weather, the club mosses would crash down. The stumps eventually hollow out. Small animals such as "Hylonomus", seeking shelter, might enter and become trapped, starving to death. Fossils of the basal pelycosaur "Archaeothyris" and the basal diapsid "Petrolacosaurus" are also found in the same region of Nova Scotia, higher up, dated about 6 million years later.

Some fossilized footprints, from about 315 mya, have been found in New Brunswick. They are attributed to "Hylonomus".
