Bossa nova

Bossa nova is a type of Brazilian music. Bossa nova means literally "new trend". Antonio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto developed bossa nova as a genre. The first bossa nova single to achieve international popularity was "The Girl From Ipanema".

The bossa nova musical style evolved from samba but is more complex harmonically and less percussive. Joachim Ernst Berendt, the writer of a jazz book, said that bossa nova is a combination of samba and cool jazz. The influence on bossa nova of jazz styles is often debated, but a similar "cool sensibility" is apparent.

Bossa nova is usually performed on classical guitar and piano. It often performed with percussion and strings.
