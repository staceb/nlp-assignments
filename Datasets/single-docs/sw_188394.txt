British Transport Commission

The British Transport Commission (BTC) was created by Clement Attlee's post-war Labour government. It was a part of its nationalisation programme. Its objective was to provide "an efficient, adequate, economical and properly integrated system of public inland transport and port facilities within Great Britain for passengers and goods", excluding transport by air. The BTC came into operation on 1 January 1948. Its first chairman was Lord Hurcomb. Miles Beevor was the Chief Secretary.
