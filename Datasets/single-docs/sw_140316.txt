If Only You Were Lonely

If Only You Were Lonely is the second album released by Hawthorne Heights. Many listeners consider the album more on the dark side, than the first Hawthorne Heights album.

The album includes a few songs where death growls are absent, and others where it is only used in a small part of the song, to make it fit better. Previously, they would use these harsh vocals a lot more.

It had three singles: "Saying Sorry", "This is Who We Are" and "Pens and Needles".
