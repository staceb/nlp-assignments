The astronomers get out of the capsule. They are tired. They unroll their blankets and sleep. A comet passes. The Big Dipper appears with human faces looking out of each star. Snowfall wakes the astronomers. They go into a cavern and find giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella. It turns into a giant mushroom.

Selenites appear. They are insectoids that live on the moon. The astronomers fight them. They are captured. They are taken to the Selenite Palace. One astronomer destroys the Chief Selenite. The astronomers run to their space capsule. They take off. They land in an ocean on Earth. A ship rescues them. A celebration is held in honor of the brave men.
