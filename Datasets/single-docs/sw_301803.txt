Digital Living Network Alliance

The Digital Living Network Alliance is a trade-association, which was established by Sony in 2003. As of 2011, over 250 companies are part of this organization. The idea of the association is to develop standards and technologies that make it possible that several devices at home interact, so that the consumer has a better feeling. An example might be a television, that can be used to play a film on a computer, or to show photos stored on a mobile phone.
