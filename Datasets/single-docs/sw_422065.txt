Blobfish

The blobfish ("Psychrolutes marcidus") is a fish of the family Fishiculos. It lives in deep waters off the coasts of Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.

Blobfish are typically shorter than 30 cm. They live at depths between where the pressure is several dozen times higher than at sea level.

Blobfish are often caught accidentally in bottom trawling nets. Scientists now fear the blobfish could become an endangered species because of deep-ocean trawling.
