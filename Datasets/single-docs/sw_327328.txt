Explorer Dr. Emmet Cole (Bruce Greenwood) went looking for magic in the Amazon. He never came back. To the millions of kids who grew up watching his nature show, Dr. Cole was a hero. To his son, Lincoln (Joe Anderson), he was more of mystery. Six months after Cole was lost, Lincoln was ready to accept that his father was dead. This changes when Dr. Cole's emergency beacon goes off. Lincoln and his mother, Tess (Leslie Hope), begin a search for his father. To pay for the rescue, they let Dr. Cole's ex-producer, Clark (Paul Blackthorne), film the mission as a documentary. They and a group of others go to the Amazon to try and find Dr. Cole.

Oren Peli and Michael R. Perry created this series about a documentary crew searching the Amazon for a scientist-explorer-television host. 

In September, 2010, ABC bought the rights to make the series. NBC also wanted to make it, but ABC offered more money. The show will broadcast on CTV in Canada.

The show has been well liked by the critics. It has a score of 65/100 from Metacritic.
