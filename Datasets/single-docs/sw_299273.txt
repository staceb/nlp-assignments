Charles Felix of Sardinia

Charles Felix (Carlo Felice Giuseppe Maria; 6 April 1765 – 27 April 1831) was born a Prince of Savoy and was later the last mainline Savoyard monarch of Sardinia. He was a nephew of Charles III of Spain and cousin of Maria I of Portugal as well as son in law of Maria Carolina of Austria. He was King of Sardinia from 1821 to 1831.

"Carlo Felice" was born in Turin as the eleventh child and fifth son born to Victor Amadeus III and Maria Antonia of Spain. From birth he was titled as the Duke of Genoa and the Marquis of Susa from 1796. He was a younger brother of Charles Emmanuel IV and Victor Emmanuel I. He spent his childhood with his sister Maria Carolina, the Count of Moriana, living at the Castle of Moncalieri. He had a very closed character. 

He was married by proxy to Princess Maria Cristina of Naples and Sicily on 7 March 1807. She was a daughter of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Maria Carolina of Austria, sister of "Marie Antoinette". 

He was not expected to ever succeed to the throne. However Charles Emmanuel never had any children and abdicated the throne on June 4, 1802. Victor Emmanuel I had four living daughters when he abdicated the throne in 1821. As the succession was regulated by the Salic Law, Charles Felix succeeded his brother on the throne. He and his wife died without issue after a reign of ten years. He was succeeded by the senior male of his House as Charles Albert of Savoy after he died in Turin at the Palazzo Chablais which had been given to him by his sister Princess Maria Anna.

The Teatro Carlo Felice in Genoa was named after him as well as the main road of the island of Sardinia, the Strada statale 131 Charles Felix, that connects the towns of Cagliari and Sassari-Porto Torres, realised in 19th century, is entitled to him.
