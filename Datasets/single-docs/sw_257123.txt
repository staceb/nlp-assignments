Her Majesty (song)

"Her Majesty" is a song written by Paul McCartney (although credited to Lennon/McCartney) that appears on The Beatles' album "Abbey Road". "Her Majesty" is the final track of the album and appears fourteen seconds after the song "The End", but was not listed on the original sleeve. As such, it is considered one of the first examples of a hidden track in rock music.

The song was recorded in three takes on July 2, 1969, before the Beatles started work on "Golden Slumbers"/"Carry That Weight". McCartney sang and played an acoustic guitar. The decision take it from the Abbey Road medley was made on July 30.
