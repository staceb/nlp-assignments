Rusty Cage

"Rusty Cage" is the third single off American rock band Soundgarden's third studio album "Badmotorfinger". The song was released in 1992.

Lead singer Chris Cornell wrote the lyrics of the song. Lead guitarist Kim Thayil said of the song: 
The tuning on that song was pretty nutty. It's recorded with a wah wah in the low position used as a filter. That was the first time we did anything like that. It was Chris's idea; he wanted to get that weird tone that you can't really dial in on an amp. But if you use the wah wah as a filter, it gets an incredibly weird sound. And if you listen to that riff, especially if you've heard the original demos of it, it almost sounds backward.

A popular cover version of the song was done by Johnny Cash, who included it on his 1996 album, "Unchained". The album won a Grammy Award for Best Country Album and Cash's version of Rusty Cage earned him a nomination for Best Male Country Vocal Performance in 1998.
