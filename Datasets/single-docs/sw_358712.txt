Jean-Georges Noverre

Jean-Georges Noverre (29 April 172719 October 1810) was a French dancer and ballet master (choreographer). He is considered the creator of the ballet d'action. He performed or held posts across Europe. His first great success was the ballet "Les Fêtes Chinoises". Other ballets include "Jason et Médée", "La Toilette de Venus", "Les Jalousies du sérail", "La dour corsaire" and "Le Jaloux sans rival". He expressed his views on dance in the book "Lettres sur la danse et les ballets" in 1756 (published in 1760). The French Revolution reduced Noverre to poverty. He died in 1810.
