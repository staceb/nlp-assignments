Traunstein (mountain)

Traunstein is the highest mountain on the east side of Lake Traunsee. It is in the district of Gmunden, Austria. The Traunstein is 1691 metres (5548 ft) high. The height is the reason why it can be seen from very far away.

On the top are two cabins, the Naturfreundehütte and the Gmundnerhütte.
