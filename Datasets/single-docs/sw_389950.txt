Wherry Lines

The Wherry Lines are railway lines in England, from Norwich to Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft. These lines go through The Broads. The line is part of the Network Rail Strategic Route 7, SRS 07.11 and is a rural line. The name of the line is taken from the Norfolk wherries, which played an important role in the transport of goods and people around the broads before road and rail transport became widespread.
