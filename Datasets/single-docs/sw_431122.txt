NHL 13

NHL 13 is an ice hockey video game. It was developed by EA Canada and published by EA Sports.

It was released on September 11, 2012 in North America, September 13, 2012 in Australasia, and on September 14, 2012 in Europe. The game was the 22nd in the "NHL" video game series and is the sequel to "NHL 12". Philadelphia Flyers forward Claude Giroux is featured on the cover of the game.

For the first time in the series, there were two playable female characters, Hayley Wickenheiser and Angela Ruggiero that were added.

IGN rated the game a 8.5 out of 10. They said, "For a full-price title, gamers get so much more than mere roster and tuner updates (which come for free and with regularity, by the way). You also get robust online and offline modes that could potentially keep you busy for hundreds of hours."

GameSpot gave the game a 8 out of 10. They said, "NHL 13 adds some great new skating physics and smarter AI, although you've already seen a lot of what the game has to offer."
