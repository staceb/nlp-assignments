Jerzmanice-Zdrój was a health resort from 1881, when a doctor from the nearby town Złotoryja made a small place for sick people called "Hermsdorf Bad". This lasted until World War II. After the war, the health resort did not re-open.

The origin of "Jerzmanice" is unknown. One theory is that this part of the name is a Polish crack from German name "Hermsdorf" or "Hermannsdorf". These names are an earlier name of Jerzmanice-Zdrój. The origin of "zdrój" is means "spring" or "spa" in English.
