Pikes Peak

Pikes Peak is a 14,110-foot mountain near Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States. It is one of the world's most famous mountains and can be seen from over 100 miles on clear days. It was named after Zebulon Pike who explored the area in 1806. The summit of the peak can be reached either by car or railway. The spectacular view from the top is what inspired Katharine Lee Bates to write "America The Beautiful" in 1893, and there is a plaque with the words to the song at the summit as well. It is also the home of the second oldest car race in the United States.
