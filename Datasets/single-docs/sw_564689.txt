A14 road

The A14 is a major road in England. It is a trunk road which runs roughly east to west, from the Port of Felixstowe, Suffolk to the junction of the M1 and M6 motorways near Rugby, Warwickshire. Along the way, it crosses the ancient main north-south route of Watling Street, now the A1.

The road forms part of the Trans European Road Network, and runs mostly through Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire.

It is part of unsigned Euroroutes E24 and E30.
