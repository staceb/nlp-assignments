Crelle's Journal

Crelle's Journal, or just Crelle, is a journal that was published monthly for mathematical articles. It was founded by August Leopold Crelle in 1826 in Berlin. The full German title is Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik (in English: "Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics").

Crelle edited the journal until his death in 1855. Lots of very important mathematical articles were published in it. Some of these were articles which had a very big influence on the development of mathematics. It published famous articles by mathematicians such as Niels Henrik Abel, Georg Cantor, and Gotthold Eisenstein. It was edited by Carl Wilhelm Borchardt from 1856–80, during which time it was known as "Borchardt's Journal". The editor today is Rainer Weissauer (Ruprecht-Karls-University, Heidelberg).
