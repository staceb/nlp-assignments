One-line diagram

The one-line diagram (or single-line diagram) is a diagram that shows a three-phase power system in a simple way. It is used in many power-related applications. Each electrical element is represented by a unique symbol. Although it describes three-phase electricity, only one conductor is shown in the diagram.
