Guckkasten

Guckkasten (Hangul: 국카스텐) is a South Korean Indie rock group that is known for psychedelic music. The members are Ha Hyun-woo (Hangul: 하현우, vocal), Jeon Kyu-ho (Hangul: 전규호), Lee Jung-gil (Hangul: 이정길) and Kim Ki-bum (Hangul: 김기범). The group formed in 2003 and their band was called "The C.O.M" at the time. <br> In 2007, they renamed their band "Guckkasten," a German word that means "Chinese-style kaleidoscope". The renaming of the band as "Guckkasten" was to reflect how their psychedelic music is like looking through a Chinese-style kaleidoscope with its beautiful and constantly changing pictures. <br>This band tries to express their experimental mindset by playing music like psychedelic videos hidden under an analogous style.


Lee Jung-gil and Ha Hyun-woo started a school band together. After quitting school, they moved to Seoul. Then they scouted Jeon Kyu-ho through the Internet and started a band "New Unbalance". 
In 2003, they realigned their members and created a band named "The C.O.M". However, "The C.O.M" broke up that year after the "Ssamji sound festival". 
Then in 2007, they formed the band again, but changed the name to "Guckkasten," a German word for Chinese-style kaleidoscope. A year later, in 2008, Kim Ki-bum joined the band.
Since then, they have performed as the band "Guckkasten" and never looked back.
