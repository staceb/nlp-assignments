A Hazy Shade of Winter

"A Hazy Shade of Winter" is a hit song performed by Simon and Garfunkel in the 1960s. It was covered by The Bangles two decades later. The song was released by itself at first, but was later released as part of the album "Bookends", released in 1968. This single is about sadness during winter. The Bangles version was released in November 1987. Both versions became major hit singles. In the late 1980s, the Bangles' version became more popular than the first version.
