Freehold (law)

In property law, a freehold (also called frank-tenement) is the ownership of real property. This includes land and everything that naturally comes with it, such as buildings, trees and natural resources. Freehold is different to a leasehold, in which the property is kept by the owner of the land after the lease has expired. Ownership of a freehold estate is indefinite amount of time.

Freehold is used in the laws of many Commonwealth countries. It comes from the United Kingdom.
