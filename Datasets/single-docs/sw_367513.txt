Henry Lawrence

Sir Henry Lawrence (in full Henry Montgomery Lawrence) (28 June 1806-4 July 1857) was a senior British officer and administrator of British India. He was the first Chief Commissioner of the Punjab after its annexation by the British, following the Second Anglo-Sikh War. He died whilst defending Lucknow against a force of rebels, during the Indian Mutiny (or First Indian War of Independence) in July 1857. 

His younger brother, Sir John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, later succeeded Sir Henry in the Punjab and became the province's first Lieutenant-Governor.
