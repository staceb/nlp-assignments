Snowman

A snowman is a statue of a person made of snow. Snowmen are usually made when people make three balls of snow that are different sizes.(In Japan, snowmen are made by two snowballs) They will stack the balls on top of each other to make a snowman, and stick some things in it to make it look more like a person like a scarf, pebbles, buttons and a carrot (for the nose).
