Iqbal Park

Iqbal Park is a park in Lahore, Pakistan. It was called Minto Park during British Indian times. It is named after "Allama" Sir Muhammad Iqbal, the National Poet of Pakistan. In the All India Muslim Leagues session of 21-24 March 1940, which was held here, the famous Lahore Resolution was passed. This led to the eventual creation of independent Pakistan in 1947. This event is remembered in this park, by the structure of the "Minar-e-Pakistan" (Pakistan Tower/Minaret), which is visited by many people every year.
