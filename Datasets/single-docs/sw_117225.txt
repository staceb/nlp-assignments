Born again (Christianity)

In Christianity, the words born again, regenerated or transformed are synonymous with spiritual rebirth and sometimes salvation from the Holy Spirit. It means having a "personal" faith in Jesus Christ. The term is most often used by Evangelical, Fundamentalists, Pentecostal and some Mainline branches of Protestant Christianity. 

The term came to be in the New Testament, where: "Jesus replied, “Very truly I tell you, no one can see the kingdom of God unless they are born again."
