Straw

Straw is the stems of cereal grains like oats or wheat, after the seeds have been removed. It is often used as bedding for animals (hay is used to feed animals). It can also be used as fuel, to make baskets, and many other things. In older times it was used for thatch roofs, or mixed with clay and sand for the cob and adobe used in building houses.
