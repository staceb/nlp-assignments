Falkenfelsen

The Falkenfelsen (Falcons Rock) is a cliff in the northern Black Forest in Baden-Württemberg, Germany. The granite rock formation is about high. From the Schwarzwaldhochstraße (Black Forest Highway), two hiking trails lead through the formation and end at the shelter "Herta-hut". From the platform there is a view over the northern Black Forest with the Hornisgrinde in the south, Bühlerhöhe in the north east and the valley of the Upper Rhine in the west side.
