Christian Soucy

Christian Soucy (born September 14, 1970 in Gatineau, Quebec) is a Canadian retired ice hockey goaltender.

Before he played in the NHL, he played 2 years at the University of Vermont where he is ranked as the third all-time in save percentage (.908) and fifth all-time in goals against average (2.99). He only appeared in three minutes of one NHL game with the Chicago Blackhawks in the 1993–94 NHL season. During that time, he did not face a shot and in doing this he was rendered as the NHL's comparable version to Major League Baseball's legendary Moonlight Graham. He played most of his 10-year career in various minor leagues, which includes the International Hockey League, American Hockey League, East Coast Hockey League, and Central Hockey League as well as others.
