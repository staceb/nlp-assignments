Bagaceratops

Bagaceratops (meaning "small horned face") was a plant-eating dinosaur that had a bony ridge along the back of its skull. This ceratopsian dinosaur lived during the late Cretaceous period, roughly 84 to 71 million years ago. "Bagaceratops" fossils have been found in Mongolia.

"Bagaceratops" had a large head, a bulky body, a parrot-like beak, cheek teeth, triangular cheek protuberances, a short snout horn, and a small frill on its head. This ornithischian (bird-hipped) dinosaur was about 3 feet (1 m) long. "Bagaceratops" walked on four short legs (it was a quadruped).

"Bagaceratops" could eat tough plants; it had powerful jaws and cheek teeth that could chew the food.
