The former Templeton College was originally formed in 1965 as the Oxford Center for Management Studies. It was renamed Templeton College in 1983 after John Templeton donated a large endowment. In 1995, Templeton College was granted a charter as a graduate college of the University.

Green Templeton College is a graduate college only. It does not have any undergraduate students.

The college is located at the former Green College campus in North Oxford. Its most notable building is the Radcliffe Observatory at the center of the campus.
