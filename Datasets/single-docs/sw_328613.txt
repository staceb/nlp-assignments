Madonna del cardellino

The Madonna del cardellino (Madonna of the Goldfinch) is an oil painting by Raphael. It was painted about 15051506. It is known as "Madonna of the Goldfinch" in English. The painting is in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. The painting has been restored. 

The three people form a triangle. The Virgin holds a book. St. John holds a goldfinch. Christ reaches for the bird. Raphael gave the painting to Lorenzo Nasi as a wedding gift. Nasi's house was destroyed by an earthquake in November 1548. The painting broke into several pieces. It was restored, but the damage could still be seen.
