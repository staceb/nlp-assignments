Saltopus

Saltopus was a small, lightly-built Upper Triassic reptile. So few bones were found that its exact nature is not known. 

It was 60 centimeters (23 in) long, not much bigger than a rabbit, and was discovered in Scotland by Friedrich von Huene in 1910. 

It was a carnivore. Not much more can be said until more remains are discovered.
