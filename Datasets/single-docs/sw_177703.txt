Chauffeur

A chauffeur is a person who drives a vehicle (car) as their job. The word can be used for anybody who drives as their job. Usually, it implies a driver of an elegant passenger vehicle (for example, a horse-drawn carriage, luxury sedan, motor coach, or especially a limousine). People who drive taxis, buses or non-passenger vehicles are generally referred to as "drivers" (as in "bus drivers" and "truck drivers").
