Quadrille

The quadrille was a type of social dance. It was a sequence dance, a lively dance by four couples arranged in the shape of a square. It became popular in France around 1760. It became popular in England in 1813. American square dancing is a later adaption of the quadrille. In Australia, the bushranger Ned Kelly danced in a quadrille during the siege at Glenrowan, Victoria.
