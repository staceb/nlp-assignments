The award process is very similar to its American counterpart, the Grammy Awards. The Latin Grammy Awards was created because its organizers thought that the many musical styles of Latin music was too big to fit on the Grammy Awards. The Latin Grammy Awards focuses on music that comes from Latin America, Spain, Portugal, and the United States. One major difference between the Grammy Awards and the Latin Grammy Awards is that a recording that does not have to be released in the United States.
