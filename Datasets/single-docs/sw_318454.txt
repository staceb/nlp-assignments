Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt

The Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt "(Eje Volcánico Transversal)" also known as the Transvolcanic Belt and locally as the Sierra Nevada (Snowy Mountain Range), is a volcanic belt that extends 900 km from west to east across central-southern Mexico. Several of its highest peaks have snow all year long, and during clear weather, they can be seen bythose who live in Mexico on the many high plateaus from which these volcanoes rise.
