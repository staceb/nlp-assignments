Volcanoes in Iceland

Many volcanoes in Iceland are active volcanoes. This is due to its location on the mid-Atlantic Ridge which is a tectonic plate boundary. Iceland has 30 active volcanic systems. Of these, 13 have erupted since the settlement of Iceland in 874 AD. The eruption under Eyjafjallajökull ("glacier of Eyjafjöll") in 2010 was notable because the volcanic ash plume disrupted air travel in northern Europe for several weeks.
