Tuesday Weld

Tuesday Weld (born August 27 1943) is an American movie and television actress. She began her acting career as a child. She has acted in many television programs and movies. 

Weld was born Susan Ker Weld in New York City. After her father died, her mother put her to work as a child model. Weld's first acting job was on television at age 12. She was in a movie the same year with a small role in the 1956 Alfred Hitchcock crime drama, "The Wrong Man". The pressures of her career, however, resulted in a nervous breakdown at age nine, alcoholism by age 12, and a suicide attempt around the same time.

Weld's mother did not like her teenage daughter's affairs with older men, such as actor John Ireland. In 1961, she had an off-screen romance with Elvis Presley, her costar in "Wild in the Country". 

Weld has been married three times. 

She was married to screenwriter Claude Harz, from 1965 until their divorce in 1971. They had a daughter, Natasha, in 1966. 

She married British actor, musician, and comedian Dudley Moore in 1975. In 1976 they had a son, Patrick. He is now an actor, director, and editor. They divorced in 1980. In 1985 she married Israeli concert violinist and conductor Pinchas Zukerman. They divorced in 1998.
