Sprouting

Sprouting is growing sprouts from seeds (germinating) to eat. Bean sprouts are a common ingredient, especially in Asian cuisine, made from sprouting beans. The typical beansprout is made from the greenish-capped mung beans ("Vigna radiata"). Other common bean sprouts are the usually yellow, larger-grained soy sprouts.
