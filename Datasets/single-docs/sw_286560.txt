Punter

A punter (P) is a position in American and Canadian football. Punters are members of the special teams. Punts punt the ball away to the opposite team during a fourth (American) or Third (Canadian) down. The punter will sometimes do a fake punt and run or throw the ball. They can also fill in for a placekicker.
