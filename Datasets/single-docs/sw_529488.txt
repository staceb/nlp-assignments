Hei Hei

Hei Hei is a suburb of Christchurch, New Zealand. It is located in the west of Christchurch from the centre of the city. State Highway 1 runs through it. The area was subdivided for poultry farming after World War I for the men returning from war, but the plan failed due to the poor soil conditions. The place name is a Māori word. It means noise, disturbance, storm, dust.
