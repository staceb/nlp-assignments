Hannah

Hannah (meaning "grace of God") is a woman in the Bible, in the book of 1 Samuel chapters 1 and 2. She was the wife of Elkanah. After she begged God for a child, she gave birth to Samuel. Samuel became a prophet of God (a voice for God in Israel). When Samuel was a young child, she took him to live in the temple (as she had promised God), to be an apprentice of Eli the priest.
