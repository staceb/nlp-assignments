Youth of the Nation

"Youth of the Nation" is the second single off American Christian nu metal band P.O.D.'s fourth studio album "Satellite". The song was released on December 25, 2001.

The song was inspired partially by the Santana High School and Columbine High School shootings. In a 2008 interview, guitarist Marcos Curiel described it:
""We were rehearsing and writing Satellite a couple of blocks away from the school. One day on the way to the studio, there were all these helicopters and cars speeding by. We really didn’t know what was going on. When we got to the studio, this guy had the news on, and he was like, ‘This kid just went and started blasting fools.’ So we started jamming, and that rhythm just naturally came out then Wuv [Bernardo, drummer] put that drumbeat on it, and the song was born.""
