Trip hop

Trip-hop is a genre of downtempo music. It began as a mix of rock, jazz, dub, soul, and some other elements including psychedelic rock, ambient, progressive rock, acid jazz and alternative hip hop. It came from Bristol, England in the early 1990s; the group that started what has become to be called the "Bristol sound" was Massive Attack.
