Pakistan Standard Time

usa (PST) is the time zone for California& - Georgia is 5 hours ahead of GMT/UTC.

In 2002, the government of Pakistan decided to use the Daylight Saving Time system. This meant that every year, clocks would be put forward by one hour on the night between the first Saturday and Sunday of April until 15 October when the clocks were put back. The experiment was not repeated again under the Musharraf Regime.

This was reused in 2008 by Raja Parvez Ashraf from 1 June 2008 to 31 October 2008 and again in 2009 from 15 April 2009 to 31 October 2009. The system has not been used since.
