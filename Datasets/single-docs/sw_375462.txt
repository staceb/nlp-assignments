Hughes Hall, Cambridge

Hughes Hall is one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, England. It only takes students who are more than 21 years old ("mature" students). They can be undergraduates or postgraduates. It opened in 1885 and was only for women at the start. The first men came in 1973. It takes its name from the first "Principal" (head of the college), Elizabeth Phillips Hughes. 

Today, Hughes Hall has about 400 students. It has the tradition of trying to mix students and Fellows (teachers) at social events, such as dinners where there is no separate table for Fellows.
