Millerites

Millerites was the name for the followers of the teachings of William Miller. In 1833, Miller said that he had done some calculations, and that the second coming of Christ would happen about the year 1843. This turned out to be false, and there was a great disappointment. Miller had documented how he did Bible interpretation, so anyone could do it. After the disappointment, some movements emerged that were generally called "Adventist".
