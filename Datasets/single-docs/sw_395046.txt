Pedra Branca, Singapore

Pedra Branca, also known as Pulau Batu Puteh and Batu Puteh, is a small island at the western edge of the South China Sea. It in the eastern entrance of the Straits of Singapore. It is the easternmost point of Singapore.

Horsburgh Lighthouse was built on the island between 1847 and 1851.

The island was the subject of a dispute between Malaysia and Singapore. In 2008, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Pedra Branca is part of Singapore.

On 2 February 2017, Malaysia applied to the ICJ pursuant to Article 61 of the Statute of the ICJ for the revision of the 2008 judgment on the basis of three documents it had obtained from The National Archives of the UK between August 2016 and January 2017. The documents were internal correspondence of Singapore's colonial government in 1958, an incident report submitted by a British naval officer in the same year, and a 1960s map of naval operations bearing annotations. The Malaysian Government said that these documents indicated that "officials at the highest levels in the British colonial and Singaporean administration appreciated that Pedra Branca/Pulau Batu Puteh did not form part of Singapore’s sovereign territory" during the relevant period.
