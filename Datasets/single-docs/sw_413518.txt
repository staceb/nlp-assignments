Hurt (Nine Inch Nails song)

"Hurt" is a song written by Trent Reznor. It was first released on Nine Inch Nails' 1994 album "The Downward Spiral". It received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Song in 1996 but lost to Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta Know".

Originally recorded by Nine Inch Nails, the song "Hurt" has been adapted and covered by several artists, including Johnny Cash and Leona Lewis. The song clearly includes references to self-harm and heroin addiction, although the overall meaning of the song is unknown. 

In 2002, Johnny Cash covered the song for his album, "". The line "crown of shit" was changed to "crown of thorns", not only removing profanity from the lyrics, but also more directly referencing Christ and Cash's devout Christianity. Its accompanying video, featuring images from Cash's life and directed by Mark Romanek, was named the best video of the year by the Grammy Awards and CMA Awards, and the best video of all time by "NME" in July 2011. The cover was released on a single with the B-side 'Personal Jesus', a cover of the Depeche Mode single.
