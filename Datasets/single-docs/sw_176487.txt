City of London School

The City of London School (CLS) is a private school for boys, aged 10 to 18, next to the River Thames in the City of London. It was established in 1442. It is the brother school of the City of London School for Girls (a girls' school within the City) and of the City of London Freemen's School (a day and boarding school in Surrey). Most boys enter the school at 11 and fewer enter at 10 and 13. There is a small intake at 16 into the sixth form.
