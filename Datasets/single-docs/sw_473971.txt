Angalifu

Angalifu (pronounced "ang-uh-LEEF-oo"; 1970–2014) was a captive northern white rhinoceros. It was held at the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. He was one of six living northern white rhinoceroses in the world, one of two living males in the world, and the only male on the American continents. 

Angalifu was born in the wild ca. 1970 before being caught and sent to the Khartoum Zoo in Khartoum, Sudan. In 1990, he was transferred on loan to the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, where he lived until his death in December 2014.
