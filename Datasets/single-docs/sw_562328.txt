Cognitive impairment

Cognitive impairment (also called cognitive deficit) is a condition in which mental functioning is not good. The term "cognitive impairment" may mean problems with intelligence, like intellectual disability (also called "mental deficiency").

Cognitive impairment may be congenital or caused by environmental problems, such as brain injuries, neurological disorders or mental illness.
