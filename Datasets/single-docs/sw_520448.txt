Sceptrum Brandenburgicum

Sceptrum Brandenburgicum (or "Sceptrum Brandenburgium" – Latin for "scepter of Brandenburg") was a constellation. It was created in 1688 by Gottfried Kirch, astronomer of the Prussian Royal Society of Sciences. It represented the scepter (a symbol of royalty or power) used by the royal family of the Brandenburgs. It was located west of the constellation of Lepus. The constellation was quickly forgotten and is not official any more. It led to a star later being called "Sceptrum". That star is now called 53 Eridani.
