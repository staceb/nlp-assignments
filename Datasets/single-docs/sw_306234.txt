Yinghuo-1

Yinghuo-1 was a Chinese spacecraft. People planned for it to be China's first interplanetary mission. Yinghuo-1 was supposed to orbit and study the planet Mars. It was launched with the Russian spacecraft Phobos-Grunt. The spacecraft got into space, but something went wrong and it couldn't escape earth's gravity. 

The name "Yinghuo" means "firefly" in Chinese.
