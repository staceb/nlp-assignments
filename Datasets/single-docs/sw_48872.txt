Material fracture

A fracture is the separation of a body into more than one piece under the action of stress.

The word "fracture" is often applied to bones of living creatures or to crystals or crystalline materials, such as gemstones or metal. Sometimes, fractures can happen without the object actually separating into two or more pieces.
