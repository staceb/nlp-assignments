Vibration control

In earthquake engineering, vibration control is a set of technical means for decreasing seismic loads and improving seismic performance of building structures.

All vibration control devices may be classified as "passive", "active" or "hybrid". The first kind is the simplest one and, therefore, widespread. Passive control devices represent different types of "base isolators" and "seismic dampers".

"Base isolators" restrict penetration of potentially damaging seismic waves into a building structure while "dampers" decrease destructive effect of those waves.
