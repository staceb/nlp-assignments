Timer

A timer is a kind of clock for measuring time intervals. A timer which counts upwards from zero for measuring time is often called a "stopwatch". A device which counts down from a specified time interval is more usually called a "timer". A simple example is an hourglass. Some timers sound an audible alarm that the time is up. Time switches, timing mechanisms which activate a switch, are sometimes called "timers".
