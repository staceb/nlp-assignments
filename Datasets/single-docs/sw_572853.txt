José Solé

José Solé (July 28, 1929 – February 15, 2017) was a Mexican stage actor, movie director, set design, and theater director. 

His career extended over 60 years. He worked to promote theater in Mexico, which did not have governmental support that the other arts did after the Mexican Revolution. He performed in and directed many plays, as well as directing theaters and even the theatrical division of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes (National Institute of Fine Arts). 

He received recognition for both acting and directing early in his career, but major awards such as Premio Nacional de Ciencias y Artes (National Prize for Arts and Sciences) in the 2000s.
