GQ

GQ (originally Gentlemen's Quarterly) is a monthly men's magazine focusing upon fashion, style, and culture for men, through articles on food, movies, physical fitness, sex, music, travel, sports, technology, and books. It is generally thought of as being more sophisticated than magazines, such as "Maxim" or "FHM". 

"Gentlemen's Quarterly" was launched in 1931 in the United States as Apparel Arts, a men's fashion magazine for the clothing trade, aimed primarily at wholesale buyers and retail sellers.
