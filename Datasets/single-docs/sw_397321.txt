WINS (AM)

WINS is a radio station in New York City, New York. It first started in 1924. It is an all-news station, using that format since 1965. It is the oldest all-news station in the United States. It is known on-air as Ten-Ten Wins. It is owned by CBS Radio.

When the station first started, it played rock and roll music. It switched to the all-news format on April 19, 1965, going with that format around the clock. Since then, the format has not seen a lot of changes, and it has been a very successful format.

WINS is known for its teletype sound effect that plays in the background and its slogans "All News, All the Time," "The Newswatch Never Stops," "Listen 2, 3, 4 times a day," and "You give us 22 minutes, we'll give you the world." The latter slogan refers to how a segment plays every 20 minutes. While other stations have stopped using the teletype sound effect, WINS has kept it.
