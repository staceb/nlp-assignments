Scaphognathus

Scaphognathus was a rhamphorhyncoid pterosaur found in the Solnhofen limestone of the Upper Jurassic. 

It had wings that was about one meter long and a long tail shaped like a leaf. The leaf-tail probably acted like a rudder, helping it steer through the air. It was probably a diurnal (daytime) flier, where "Rhamphorhynchus" was probably nocturnal.

Scaphognathus ate "Pholidophorus" fish.
