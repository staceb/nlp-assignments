Game Maker

Game Maker is a computer program for the Windows operating system. It was first made by Mark Overmars, but it is now made by the company YoYo Games.

Game Maker lets people make computer games without knowing a computer programming language. People who know how to use programming languages can use Game Maker's own programming language, called Game Maker Language.

The newest version is Game Maker Studio. Since the first version made in 1999, Game Maker was given many new features. One of these features is 3-D graphics.

Game Maker has a drag-and-drop interface. This lets people make games using mostly the computer mouse. Game Maker uses icons that tell the person what actions they can do. People can make simple games by moving these icons into a given order. More detailed games can be made when Game Maker Language is used.

Game Maker has an internet community and website. There, people who use Game Maker can put their games up for others to play. People can also get help on using Game Maker from other people.

Game Maker started as an animation program called "Animo". Each new version of Game Maker added new features. Starting with version 7.0, Game Maker was published by the YoYo Games company. 

In May 22, 2012, YoYo Games released GM:Studio. After that GM:HTML5 is no longer supported.GM:Studio allows users to publish their games to Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, Linux Ubuntu and HTML5.
