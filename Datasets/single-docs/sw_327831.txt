Cantor (church)

A cantor is the chief singer in Jewish or Christian worship. 
The cantor's duties and qualifications have varied a lot in different times and places. In Roman Catholic and Anglican worship the cantor is the person (usually a man) who sings the solo parts of a chant, while the choir sing the choral parts. In the Middle Ages the cantor came to be the supervisor or director of the choir. In Anglican cathedrals they are often known as the "precentor".
