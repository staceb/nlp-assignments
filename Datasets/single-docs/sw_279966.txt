Collage

Collage is an art term. It is a work of art like a painting but with pieces of paper and fabric ('found objects') stuck on a surface such as a piece of paper, wood or canvas. 

Collage is a popular technique in modern art. Types of collage are 'decoupage', photomontage and digital collage. When actual painting is included, or any other medium, the technique is called 'mixed media'. Work in three dimensions may be called 'assemblage'.
