Oxford Circus

Oxford Circus is the busy intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street in the West End of London. It is served by Oxford Circus tube station, which is directly beneath the junction itself.

The Circus was constructed in the beginning of the 19th century, and was designed by John Nash.

In 2009, Westminster City Council started a £4m scheme for the area, allowing shoppers to cross the intersection diagonally as well as the usual 'straight ahead', turning it into a "pedestrian scramble", much like Tokyo's Shibuya crossing. 

The crossing opened on November 2nd of the same year, by which time the cost had risen to £5 million. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said it was "a triumph for British engineering, Japanese innovation and good old common sense". Others noted that a similar crossing in Balham, South London had opened in 2005 at a cost of only £98,000.
