Let It Be (song)

"Let It Be" is a song by The Beatles, released in March 1970 as a single, and (in an alternate mix) as the title track of their album "Let It Be". 

It was written by Paul McCartney and John Lennon. It was their final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band (by that time, Lennon had already left). 

Both the "Let It Be" album and the US single "The Long and Winding Road" were released after McCartney's announced departure from and subsequent break-up of the group.

"Let It Be" holds the number-one spot on "The Fans' Top 10" poll included in "The 100 Best Beatles Songs: An Informed Fan's Guide" by Stephen J. Spignesi and Michael Lewis. The song is number three in the 100 Best Beatles Songs list, only behind "Strawberry Fields Forever" and "A Day in the Life", which is number one.
