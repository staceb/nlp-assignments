Amulet

An amulet (from Latin "amuletum", meaning "charm"), is an object that people think will bring good luck and or protection to its owner.

Usually amulets are gems, statues, coins, drawings, pendants, rings, plants, animals, etc. Even words can be amulets, such as "vade retro satana"—(Latin, "go back, Satan"), to make bad luck go away.
