Mikey Way

Michael James Way (born September 10, 1980) is an American musician. He was the bass guitarist for the rock band My Chemical Romance. Way is the younger brother of the band's singer Gerard Way. He is from Belleville, New Jersey. Way grew up with his brother Gerard and their parents Donald and Donna Way (nee Rush).

Mikey Way joined My Chemical Romance in 2001. The other members of the band were his older brother and singer, Gerard Way, drummer Matt Pelissier, and lead guitarist Ray Toro. He is most notable for giving the band its name from an Irvine Welsh novel he read while working at a Barnes and Noble. The novel was "Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance." 
After several weeks on their first tour, Mikey left college to play with the band full time. He has always been a main member of My Chemical Romance, but he left the band for a short time in early 2007. This was shortly after his marriage to Alicia Simmons. He was replaced by Matt Cortez on that tour. He rejoined the band later that year. Way was with the band for the rest of the time, until the band broke up on March 22, 2013. 

Way has performed on all five of the band's studio albums.
