File server

A file server is a computer joined to a web network or to a home network, and that can store many files in the server's hard disk(s). 

The file server can be a normal computer, or a Network Attached Storage, which is a special computer created to only be a file server. Often people recycle their old computer and they modify it to become a file server which can hold photos, songs, films, and backups. Sometimes web servers that are "hand made" are used as a media center, people put things on the file server (for example movies) and then watch (or use) the things on the file server, often on a Television (like how a DVD player works).
