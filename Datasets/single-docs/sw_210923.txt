Josei

Josei anime is anime intended for women older than high school age. "Josei" means “women”. It is the next female demographic after shōjo. Much like shōnen and seinen there is a little overlap. Some anime fitting both demographics.

Josei might share some traits with shôjo, but josei tends to be more realistic. The stories portrayed in Josei anime are usually more like real life than the stories found in shôjo. This is because the Josei audience is more mature, and want more mature anime.
