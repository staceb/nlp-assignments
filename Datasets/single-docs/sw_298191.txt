Penryn (Cornwall)

Penryn is a small town in south Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is on the Penryn River about one mile (1.6 km) northwest of Falmouth. The population was 7,166 in the 2001 census. 

Penryn was in the Middle Ages an important port but underwent a severe decline after Falmouth had been established in the 17th century. Today it is a busy town and has managed to retain a much of its heritage; a large proportion of its buildings date back to Tudor, Jacobean and Georgian times, the town is an important conservation area, and has more listed buildings than any other town in Cornwall.
