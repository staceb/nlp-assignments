Time in Argentina

Argentina is at a place that would naturally put it in the UTC−4 time zone. It actually uses the UTC−3 time zone. Argentina decides whether to have daylight saving time on a year-by-year basis. The provinces may choose to follow the national choice or not. In 2009, Argentina did not have daylight saving time.
