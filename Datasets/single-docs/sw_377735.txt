José B. Nísperos

José B. Nísperos (December 30, 1887–September 1, 1922) was a member of the Philippine Scouts. He received the Medal of Honor during the Philippine-American War. He was the first Asian to receive the medal. On September 24, 1911, at Lapurap, Basilan, Philippines, Nísperos, a member of the U.S. Army's 34th Company of the Philippine Scouts, defended his unit's position against natives armed with spears despite being severely wounded. Nísperos became the first Filipino and Asian to receive the medal of honor; the medal was presented by Brigadier General Bell in February 1913.

Citation:
Having been badly wounded (his left arm was broken and lacerated and he had received several spear wounds in the body so that he could not stand) continued to fire his rifle with one hand until the enemy was repulsed, thereby aiding materially in preventing the annihilation of his party and the mutilation of their bodies.
