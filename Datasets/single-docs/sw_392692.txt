Ayalon River

Ayalon River (, "Nahal Ayalon", "Nahr el barideh" or Wadi Musrara, in Arabic) is a river in central Israel. The river starts in the Judaean Mountains and flows as a dry river from the mountains to the Ayalon Valley in the Shfela region. After this, it flows into a floodplain in the Ayalon Park and gets filled with water. After that it turns into a channel flowing alongside Road 20 in Tel Aviv and also a railway track beside it and flows to the Yarkon River inside the Yarkon Park at the end.
