The Cat in the Hat

The Cat in the Hat is a children's book written by Dr. Seuss and was first published in 1957. Seuss wrote the book after being challenged to write a story beginning readers would love. He was given a list of 438 words beginning readers were expected to know. He was told these were the only words he could use. He used 223 words on the list. The Cat would appear in other Dr. Seuss books. More than 11 million copies of the book have been printed. It has been translated into more than 12 different languages including Latin and Yiddish. The story has been made into television shows and a 2003 movie. The Cat appears in a Broadway musical called "Seussical". 

Two children are left at home alone on a rainy day. They are visited by a cat wearing a red and white striped hat and a red bowtie. He performs all sorts of tricks. He balances a cup, a cake, an umbrella, and other things while standing on a ball. The Cat gets a box from outside. Inside are two creatures named Thing One and Thing Two. The Things begin to fly kites in the house. The children catch the Things with a net. The house is a mess. The Cat cleans it up. He leaves just before the mother comes home.
