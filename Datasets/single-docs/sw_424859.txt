Bernardo Bellotto

Bernardo Bellotto (1721 or 1722 – 17 October 1780) was an Italian urban landscape painter or "vedutista", and printmaker in etching. Today, he is mostly remembered for his "vedute" of European cities (Dresden, Vienna, Turin and Warsaw). He was the pupil and nephew of Canaletto and sometimes used the latter's illustrious name, signing himself as Bernardo Canaletto. In Germany and Poland, Bellotto called himself by his uncle's name, Canaletto.

In his paintings, Bellotto paid great attention to the way he represented works of architecture and how the light illuminated the scene. It is plausible that Bellotto, and other Venetian masters of "vedute", may have used the camera obscura in order to achieve superior precision of urban views.
