Mount Kyllini

Mount Kyllini or Mount Cyllene Greek: Κυλλήνη, sometimes Ζήρια, is a mountain on the Peloponnese peninsula in Greece. It is famous for its association with the god Hermes. Mount Kyllini rises to above sea level. This makes it the second highest point on the peninsula. It is located near the border between the historic regions of Arcadia and Achaea—in the northeast of Arcadia. It is located west of Corinth, northwest of Stymfalia, north of Tripoli, and south of Derveni.

Much of the mountain is desolate and rocky. The area below is largely forested. There is an observatory at , at 22.67 east longitude and 37.97 north latitude. Roads pass near the southern and western slopes, but there are not many on the mountain itself, as much of the mountain is part of a park.
