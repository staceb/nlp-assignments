Diastema

A diastema is a large gap between teeth. It is a normal feature in many types of land vertebrates, especially mammals. A good example are carnivores like the cat, which has a gap between its canine teeth and its slicing molar teeth. Horses, too, have a diastema between their incisors (which pull the grass) and their molars (which grind it).
