Washiqur Rahman

Washiqur Rahman (Bengali: ওয়াশিকুর রহমান বাবু) (c. 1988 - March 30, 2015) was a Bangladeshi blogger. He was hacked to death by two men with meat cleavers in Dhaka, Bangladesh, after he wrote blog posts critical of Islam.

Washiqur Rahman, also spelled Oyasiqur Rhaman, was part of the 2013 Shabag movement, which called for the death penalty for Islamists for war crimes during the 1971 war for independence from Pakistan. 

Rahman used the pen name Kucchit Hasher Channa, or Ugly Duckling. Two students from an Islamic school were arrested by police. The two said they didn't know about Rahman's writing and they didn't know anything about blogs. Someone told them to kill Rahman as a religious duty. One of the attackers traveled from Chittagong and stayed overnight at a mosque. The other attacker was from an Islamic school in Dhaka. Rahman had a page on Facebook that said "I am Avijit", meaning he was a supporter of Avijit Roy, a Bangladeshi-American blogger who was killed a month earlier. 

On July 20, 2016, a Dhaka court indicted five people for the killing. Police believed they were members of the banned militant group Ansarullah Bangla Team.
