River Parrett

The River Parrett is a major river of the County of Somerset. It starts in the County of Dorset near Chedington. From here it flows in a northwesterly direction through the Somerset Levels to Bridgewater. It flows into the Bristol Channel close to Burnham-on-Sea. At the mouth of the river is Bridgewater Bay National Nature Reserve. The river is tidal for 18.6 miles (30 km) up to the hamlet of Oath, some 10 mile south east of Bridgewater. The river has a very slight fall between Langport and Bridgwater, only 1 foot per mile, or 20cm per km, and is prone to frequent flooding, in winter and high tides.

The River Parrett is 37 miles (60km) long and its main tributaries include the Rivers Tone, Isle and Yeo. The River Cary drains into the Parrett via the King's Sedgemoor Drain. The River Parrett drains an area of over 1,690 km2 (652.5 sq mi), comprising around 50% of the land area of Somerset.
