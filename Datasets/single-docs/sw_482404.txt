Chevrolet Cobalt

Chevrolet Cobalt was a compact car sold by the General Motors division Chevrolet from 2005 to 2010. It replaced the Cavalier and the Geo Prizm (although the Pontiac Vibe serves as the Prizm's replacement, many auto sites list the Cobalt as a secondary successor). From 2005 to 2009, it was sold under the Pontiac marque under various names including the Pursuit, Pursuit G4 and the G5. The Cobalt was available as a sedan and coupé, while the G5 was strictly a coupé in America and offered as a sedan model in Canada. It was replaced by the Chevrolet Cruze (a rebadged Daewoo Lacetti Premiere). The Pontiac G5 was replaced by the Buick Verano. As of 2014, GM was recalling this car because of problems with the ignitions that can shut off the engine without warning and cause disabled air bags and cause serious injury or death. Chevrolet Cobalt was considered an improvement over its predecessor the Cavalier because it earned a "Good" crash test rating from the IIHS, but without optional side airbags it earned a "Poor" in side impact tests. However, with the optional side airbags it earned an "Acceptable".
