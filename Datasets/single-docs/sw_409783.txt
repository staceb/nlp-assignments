Paloma

Paloma is a female given name. It comes from the Latin word "palumba", which means "dove". This name is often understood to mean a Christian type of symbol of The Holy Spirit in this bird. The name is common in Italy, Spain and Hungary.

In November 2008, Hurricane Paloma caused heavy destruction over the Cayman Islands and Cuba. The name "Paloma" was then retired and replaced with "Paulette" for 2014.
