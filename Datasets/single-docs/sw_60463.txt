Microdon

Flies in the genus Microdon are a type of hoverfly. "Microdon" and its subfamily are different from most other flies because they are myrmecophiles. This means they live in ant colonies (nests). There are more than 350 species of "Microdon" in the world. Some of these will be split off in time because "Microdon" has been used as a catch-all for various unrelated species. Most "Microdon" live in the tropics; 30 species live in North America.

"Microdon" adults are very hairy and look like bees. They are 8 to 15 mm long. The antennae are almost as long as the fly's face. These flies have black or pale (white or golden) hairs, and their bodies are either black or metallic green or blue.

The larvae of "Microdon" flies look strange. They are very round and look like stout little slugs. At first scientists thought they were mollusks and scale insects. They move slowly.

Adult "Microdon" flies do not hover around flowers such as many other hoverflies; instead they remain close to the ant colonies where they grew up.

Larvae may be found very deep in ant nests. Some "Microdon" larvae eat ant larvae (Duffield 1981); others are scavengers, which means they eat dead plants or insects in the ant colony. Most "Microdon" larvae can only live in the colony of one kind of ant.
