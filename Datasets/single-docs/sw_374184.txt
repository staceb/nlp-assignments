In 2003, Ryu pitched for his school in the Michoohall National High School Championship. He recorded an 0.00 ERA in 3 games.

In 2004, he went through the Tommy John surgery. So he did not show up in any official games.

In 2005, he led his team to the top place of the Blue Dragon Open National High School Championship. He pitched 1.54 ERA in 53 and 2/3 Innings, earning 6 wins and 1 loss.

Ryu Hyun-Jin played well in the Amateur League. So Ryu was selected by the Hanwha Eagles as the 1st pick in 2006. His professional league debut was on April 12, 2006 pitching against LG Twins. That day he earned his first league win. He allowed only 3 hits and no runs for 7 and 1/3 innings. He became a sensation in the league from his debut. And finished the season with 18-6, 2.23 ERA and 205 strikeouts in 201 and 2/3 innings. In his first year, he got the pitching Triple Crown, and was named both Rookie of the year and Player of the Year.

Since then, Ryu kept his place as a top pitcher in the league. And he won many personal titles.

In August 2008, Ryu played for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The South Korea national baseball team won the gold medal. For this, Ryu does not have to join the Military for 2 years like other men in South Korea.

In March 2009, he played for the South Korea national baseball team in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. His team finished in second place.

In 2010, Ryu played in the 2010 Asian Games. The South Korea national baseball team won the gold medal.

Ryu always showed his wish to play in the Major League Baseball. The Korea Baseball Organization allows their players to make a contract with a Major League team after playing 7 years in the Korean League. But the agreement of the player's original team is needed. After the 2012 season, Ryu used this rule to play in the Major League Baseball league. The Los Angeles Dodgers suggested $25,737,737.33 to get the agreement from his original team, the Hanwha Eagles. Hanwha Eagles accepted the suggestion, and the Los Angeles Dodgers and Ryu agreed on his salary and contract years on December 10, 2012.
