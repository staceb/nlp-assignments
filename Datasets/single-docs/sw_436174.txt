Physalis

The Physalis is a genus of plants that is part of the nightshade family. There are between 75 and 90 species. All except one are native to the Americas.

The plants grow small orange fruit encased in a lantern-like husk that comes from the calyx. They are similar to the tomato. Since it has a mild, refreshing acidity similar to the tomato, it can be used in many of the same ways. Many "Physalis" species are called groundcherries.
