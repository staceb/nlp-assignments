Goji

Goji, goji berry or wolfberry is the fruit of "Lycium barbarum" and "Lycium chinense". These are two very closely related species of boxthorn in the family Solanaceae (which also includes the potato, tomato, eggplant, deadly nightshade, chili pepper, and tobacco). The two species are native to Asia.
