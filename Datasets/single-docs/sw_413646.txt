Death anniversary

A death anniversary is the custom of commemorating the date of someone's death. It is observed in several Asian cultures, including among Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Jewish and Vietnamese people. The tradition has also been associated with Confucianism, Buddhism, Hinduism and Judaism. Like a birthday, it is celebrated each year. Instead of on the date of birth of the individual being celebrated, it is celebrated on the day on which a family member or other loved one died.
