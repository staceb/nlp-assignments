Robert J. Bentley

Robert Julian Bentley (born February 3, 1943) is an American politician and medical doctor. Bentley is the 53rd Governor of Alabama serving from 2011 through 2017. A member of the Republican Party, Bentley was elected Governor in 2010 and was sworn in on January 17, 2011. He resigned on April 10, 2017.

On April 5, 2016, Republican State Representative Ed Henry filed an impeachment resolution against Bentley in the State Legislature, in connection with allegations that Bentley engaged in an extramarital affair with a female political adviser. Bentley has admitted to making inappropriate remarks toward the woman, but denied having a physical affair. 

On July 7, 2016, the House Judiciary Committee named a special counsel to lead the investigation into the impeachment charges against the governor. On April 5, 2017, the Ethics Commission found probable cause that Bentley violated both ethics and campaign finance laws.

Bentley resigned on April 10, 2017.
