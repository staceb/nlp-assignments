People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA ) is one of the world's largest non-profit organisations about animal rights. The four main beliefs of PETA are that animals are not to be used for food, clothes, exploitation or testing. The headquarters of the organization is in Norfolk, Virginia in the United States. PETA was started by Ingrid Newkirk and Alex Pacheco in 1980.

PETA has protested fast food chain KFC for the way it kills chickens. In the past, it has protested many corporations including Iams, which makes pet food. 

PETA's main website is made for adults and vegans. They also have another website called PETA2 which is made for teenagers who are vegetarian, vegan or still deciding. PETA says it has over five million members.
