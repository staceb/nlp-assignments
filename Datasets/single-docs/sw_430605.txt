Players clear blocks that come down by lining them up in horizontal or vertical lines of three or more blocks. The lines have to have the same kind of block. As new blocks come down, the playfield rises. If it makes it to the top, the player loses. The player can stop the playfield from rising by clearing blocks. In two-player games, clearing more than one line at once making combos causes "garbage" blocks to come down on the opponent's side of the field. Garbage blocks can be cleared by clearing lines below it.

There are several single-player modes. In Story Mode, the player plays through the game's story. The player faces against opponents in head-to-head matches. The player has to make their opponent lose by causing their playfield to make it to the top. In Endless Mode, the player plays as long as possible; with the speed becoming faster over time. In Timed Mode, the player has to score as many points as possible in two minutes. In Stage Clear, the player goes through a series of stages where they have to clear blocks below a line. In Puzzle Mode, the player goes through puzzles where they have to clear blocks in a certain amount of moves.

There are also multiplayer modes which are two-player versions of the single-player modes.
