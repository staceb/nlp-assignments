Pentene

Pentene is the name of alkenes with the formula CH. They are hydrocarbons. In total, there are five different pentenes. Pentens occur in cracking processes and in natural gas. Pentenes are used for polymerization, and for the synthesis of isoprene, amyl alcohols and Alkylphenols. Amyl alcohols are used as stabilizers in the production of Chloroform and Dichloromethane to stop phosgene from being made.
