Breuil-Cervinia

Breuil-Cervinia is a village in the Valle d'Aosta region of Italy. It is famous for its ski resort, which has a link to the one in Zermatt, Switzerland. 

Breuil-Cervinia is a "frazione" of the "comune" of Valtournenche. It is at 2,006 m above sea level. It stands below the Matterhorn (in Italian: "Cervino", in French: "Cervin"). The name of the village comes from "Breuil", which is the French name of the valley where the village is, and "Cervinia" from the Italian name of the Matterhorn. The FIBT bobsleigh world championships took place here for three years: 1971, 1975 and 1985. The Giro d'Italia also had a stage (a day of racing) finishing here for three times: 1960, 1997 and 2012.
