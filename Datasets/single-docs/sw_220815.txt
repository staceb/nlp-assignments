Chasmosaurus

Chasmosaurus was a rhinoceros-like dinosaur, the order of bird-hipped, herbivorous dinosaurs. It was a member of the suborder Marginocephalia, and the family of large, horned, herding herbivores, the ceratopsians. "Chasmosaurus" was named by paleontologist Lawrence Lambe in 1914.

Chasmosaurus lived 65 to 100 million years ago and was 5 to 6 metres long with a weight of 3.6 tonnes -- about as much as 2 cars.

They lived in western North America from Alaska to Mexico.
