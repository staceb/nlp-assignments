Angola colobus

The Angola colobus ("Colobus angolensis") is an arboreal monkey that belongs to the "Colobus" genus. They have no thumbs, which is not normal among primates. This allows them to shape their fingers into a winging hook. They eat leaves, fruit, and seeds.

Angolan colobus monkeys have glossy, black fur covers much of the body, but contrasts with short, white hair surrounding the face, a u-shaped, cape-like mantle of long white hair that extends down the shoulders and across the lower back, and a bushy white tuft to the tip of the tail. Colobus monkeys typically can weigh 2 lbs and grow over 2 feet long. Their lifespan is 20 to 30 years in the wild.

Colobus monkeys live in the trees of the African savannah and tropical forests.
