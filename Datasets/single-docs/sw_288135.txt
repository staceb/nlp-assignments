WWE Tough Enough

WWE Tough Enough is a professional wrestling reality television program produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Participants trained professionally and competed for a contract with WWE. There were two winners each season for the first three competitions. They were aired on MTV. A fourth competition was held in 2004, with only a single winner, but was integrated into UPN's "SmackDown!". In October 2010, the USA Network said they would revive "Tough Enough". The new series will begin airing on April 4, 2011.
