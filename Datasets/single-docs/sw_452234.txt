Battle of Bryn Glas

The Battle of Bryn Glas was fought on 22 June 1402. This was the major battle of the Welsh Revolt (1400-1415). The rebel forces of Wales, led by Owain Glyndŵr defeated the English army led by Sir Edmund Mortimer. The exact location of the battle is not known, but research shows that it was probably on Bryn Glas hill, to the east, west and south of the church of St. Mary. The English attacked the Welsh forces who were on the top of the hill. During the battle, Mortimer was captured by the Welsh. The bodies of the dead English, were left on the battlefield; later the bones were collected and buried in the churchyard.
