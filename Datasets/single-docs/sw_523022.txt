Wasted username

A wasted username or wasted account is a user account on a website that was not used very much (or at all) after it was made. A person who makes an account like this is called a namewaster or a name waster.

This word came from YouTube, where many people would post both funny and hateful comments on namewasters' YouTube channels. This was an Internet phenomenon until 2012, when YouTube deleted a lot of these wasted accounts.
