Singapore Chinese Orchestra

The Singapore Chinese Orchestra (SCO) is Singapore’s only professional Chinese orchestra.

As the main one of local performing arts groups, the SCO has the patronage of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. It is located at the Singapore Conference Hall since 2001 after the revamp of the building. Under the baton of music director Sheng Hui, the 70-strong orchestra aspires to introduce Chinese orchestral music to an ever-broadening audience.
