Lake McKenzie

Lake McKenzie (Boorangoora) is a perched lake on Fraser Island in Queensland, Australia. The lake is located in the Great Sandy National Park. Fraser Island is the world's largest sand island and is also a World Heritage site. Half of the world's perched lakes are found on the island.

The lake is 6.2 km southeast of Kingfisher Resort. It is 1,200 metres long and up to 930 metres wide. It covers an area of about 150 hectares.

The sand around the lake is pure, white silica. The water in the lake is also so pure it is unsuitable for many species.

Facilities for visitors around the lake include camping areas, picnic areas, toilets and barbecues.

In March 1944 a military training camp was set up at the lake. It was closed late the same year.

The lake served as the final Roadblock location and the finish line of the TV series "The Amazing Race Australia 2".
