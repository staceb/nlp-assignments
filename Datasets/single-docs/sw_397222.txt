Edward Mooney House

The Edward Mooney House is at 18 Bowery at the corner of Pell Street in the borough of Manhattan in New York City. It is in an area which is today known as Chinatown. The house was built between 1785 and 1789 by rich butcher Edward Mooney on land that was originally part of the Doyer bouwerie (farm) and afterwards belonged to the British Loyalist James Delancey. The land was confiscated by the new American Government after the American Revolution and sold at auction. Mooney would live in the house untul his death in 1800.

The house was built of brick in the Early Federal style. It has three stories plus an attic and full basement. The home was built close to the slaughterhouses, holding pens and tanneries just east of the freshwater Collect Pond.

In 1807, the size of the house was doubled by an addition to the rear. The house would be used as a private residence until the 1820s. Later, it has been a hotel, brothel and Barney Flynn's saloon.

The house was designated a New York City landmark in 1966 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. The Edward Mooney House was sold in January 2013 for $5.4 million dollars.
