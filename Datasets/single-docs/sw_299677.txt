The Jamuna River (Bangla: যমুনা "Jomuna") is one of the three major rivers of Bangladesh. The river flows from India to Bangladesh and is a major channel of the Brahmaputra River. The Jamuna flows in the "southward direction" and meets the Padma River ("Pôdda") and Meghna River near Goalundo Ghat and Chandpur respectively. These waters then together flow into the Bay of Bengal.

The Jamuna is known to be a very wide river. The breadth of the river, from bank to bank, is about 2 miles in the dry season while its about 5 miles during the rainy season. The River also acts as an important resource for transportation.
