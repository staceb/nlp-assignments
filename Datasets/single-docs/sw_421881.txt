IPad Air

The iPad Air is the fifth type of iPad made by Apple Inc. It was announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. It first came with iOS 7 installed on it, but now has iOS 8. The iPad Air contains the 64-bit Apple A7 processor and another M7 coprocessor. Apple released the iPad Air on November 1, 2013.

The iPad Air is 7.5 millimeters thick, which is thinner than both the iPad 2 and the iPad Mini. It has a smaller screen bezel which looks like the one on the iPad Mini. However, it still uses the same 9.7-inch Retina Display as the previous iPad model. It runs the 2014 version of Apple's iOS operating system, iOS 8.

The iPad Air was first announced at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts on October 22, 2013. The name of the event was "We still have a lot to cover."

The iPad Air can run iOS 7. It can act as a mobile hotspot, sharing its internet connection over Wi-Fi, USB, or Bluetooth. It can have access to the App Store, where users can buy and download mobile applications onto their device.
