Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab

Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab was an organization in Denmark. It was established in 1815 when king Frederick VI of Denmark had been inspired while visiting the Congress of Vienna in Austria The organization was finally disestablished on 28 October 2004 after a meeting inside the Garnison Church in Copenhagen. Queen Marie of Denmark was appointed protector of the organization. That position was then held by someone from the Danish royal family. Queen Marie's birthday was always celebrated as an observance by the organization. They gave awards to domestic workers who had been in long-time service. Most other domestic workers used to leave by the age of 25-30 to form their own family. The organization also ran a school for housemaid girls. In 1828 they also opened Denmark's first daycare center.

The organization was disestablished as their activity had been outdated. However the housemaid girls at some places had been replaced by modern nanny girls.

When the organization was disestablished, Niels Gustav Bardenfleth published the book "For lang och tro tjeneste. Det Kvindelige Velgørende Selskab 1815-2004".
