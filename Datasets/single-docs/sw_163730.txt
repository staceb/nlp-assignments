Tropical Storm Marco (2008)

Tropical Storm Marco was the smallest tropical cyclone ever. It was the 13th named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season. Marco started from a large storm over the northwestern Caribbean Sea during late September 2008. It later became a tropical depression. Marco reached its peak strength with winds of 65 miles per hour (100 km/h) on October 7. Marco hit land near Misantla, Veracruz. Because it was a very small storm, Marco caused little damage.
