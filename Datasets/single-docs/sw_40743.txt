Columbine High School massacre

The Columbine High School Massacre was a school shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, near Denver, Colorado on April 20, 1999.

Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, two students at the school, came to school armed with shotguns and assault rifles. They walked through the school firing randomly at other students and teachers. Before killing themselves in the school's library, they killed 12 students and a teacher, and hurt 21 other students.

It was one of the first well-known massacres at a school in the United States, and the one with the most deaths until the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007.

After the shooting, many people wanted to know why it had happened. Many people thought that Klebold and Harris had done it because they were bullied, and schools in the United States began talking about how to stop bullying. However, it is now thought that Klebold and Harris were bullies themselves. Other people blamed parts of the media, saying that the lyrics of bands and singers like Marilyn Manson and violent video games that the shooters played might have caused it.

In 2002, filmmaker Michael Moore released a documentary movie called "Bowling for Columbine" that was about why the shooting happened and about the role guns have in American culture. In the movie, Moore interviewed Marilyn Manson.
