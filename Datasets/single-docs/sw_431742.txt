Elizabeth Jane Howard, Lady Amis, CBE, FRSL (26 March 1923 – 2 January 2014) was an English novelist. Before being a writer, Howard was an actress and a model.

Howard died at the age of 90, at her home in Bungay, Suffolk.

She married Sir Peter Scott in 1942. They had a daughter, Nicola (born 1943). Howard left Scott in 1946 and they divorced in 1951. 

Her second marriage to Jim Douglas-Henry in 1958 was brief. Her third marriage to novelist Sir Kingsley Amis lasted from 1965 until their divorce in 1983. Her stepson, Martin Amis, has said that she encouraged him to become a more serious reader and writer.
