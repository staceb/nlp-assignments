Pickford's House Museum

Pickford's House Museum of Georgian Life and Costume, No 41 Friar Gate Derby, is a nice Georgian house built by the great architect Joseph Pickford in 1770 for his own family. Pickford had a number of notable customers. One of them was a painter Joseph Wright, whose works can be found in local Derby Museum. The Pickford's museum that was set up in 1988 shows the housing of a late Georgian professional person. The ground floor is furnished as it might have been in Pickford's time together with displays of eighteenth and nineteenth century costume. It is owned and run by the Derby City Council.

"Pickford's House" was intended to showcase his work, with the intention of securing new contacts. It was also his residence. At the rear of the property Pickford had his builder's yard, access being by a driveway to the right of the property.
