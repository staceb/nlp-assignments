International Formula 3000

Formula 3000 was a type of formula racing, below Formula One and above Formula Three. It was named because the cars were powered by 3000 cc engines. The International Formula 3000 was introduced by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) in 1985 to replace Formula Two, and was itself replaced by the GP2 Series in 2005.
