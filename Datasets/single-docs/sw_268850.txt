Panoplosaurus

Panoplosaurus was an armored tank-like dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous, living about 76–73 million years ago. 

"Panoplosaurus" was a herbivore (a plant-eater). It ate low-lying plants, like ferns and cycads. This nodosaurid ankylosaur (with no tail club) was about 23 ft (7 m) long and weighed about 3.5 tons. It had a bulky body, four short legs, a short neck, and a stiff tail.
