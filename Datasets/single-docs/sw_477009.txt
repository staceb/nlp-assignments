Genevieve

Saint Genevieve is a saint in Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox tradition. She is the patron saint of Paris. Her feast day is kept on January the 3rd.

In 451 she led a "prayer marathon" in Paris that was said to divert Attila's Huns away from the city. In 464 Childeric I besieged the city and conquered it. She negotiated to collect food and convinced Childeric to release his prisoners.

Clovis I founded an abbey where Genevieve could minister. She was later buried there. The church witnessed numerous miracles at her tomb. Genevieve was canonised.
