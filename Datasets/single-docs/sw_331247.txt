Connellan Airways

Connellan Airways (later called Connair) was an Australian airline that operated in northern Australia. It was founded by Edward Connellan (1912–1983) on 23 July 1943. The airline flew planes between remote areas of the outback. They worked a lot with the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

The name was changed to Connair in 1970. Connair had money problems in the 1970s. The company was sold to another airline company on 14 March 1980. It was liquidated (turned into money and dismantled) shortly after.
