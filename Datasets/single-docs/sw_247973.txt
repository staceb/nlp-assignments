Grizzly Rage

Grizzly Rage is a Syfy (used to be called The Sci-Fi Channel) television movie.

Four high school friends go to the woods to celebrate their graduation. When they break into a part of the woods that is closed, they hit and kill a grizzly cub with their car. Now the mother of the cub tries to attack and kill the four teenagers.

The movie is widescreen, has a Dolby Digital English 5.1 stereo track, and has no extras.

David Johnson, of DVD Verdict, said that there are better ways to spend your time instead of watching this movie. Paul Mavis, of DVD Talk, said that the movie fulfills none of the requirements of a bear attack exploitationer. A Bloody Disgusting review says that the movie is a pretty silly but satisfying flick.
