Wuhan

Wuhan () is the capital of Hubei province, People's Republic of China, and is the city with most people in Central China. It is at the east of the Jianghan Plain, where the Yangtze and Han rivers meet. Joining three nearby cities, Wuchang, Hankou, and Hanyang, Wuhan is a center of transportation, with many railways, roads and expressways passing through. Because of its important role in transportation, Wuhan was sometimes called the "Chicago of China." It is also recognized as the political, economic, financial, cultural, and educational center of central China. 

The city of Wuhan, first called so in 1927, has 10,020,000 people (as at 2011). In the 1920s, Wuhan was the national capital of a Kuomintang (KMT) government led by Wang Jingwei when he was against Chiang Kai-shek, and it was also the capital in 1937.
