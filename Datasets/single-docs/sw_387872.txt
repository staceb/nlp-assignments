Chevron Corporation

Chevron Corporation () is a large international energy company, based in San Ramon, California. It employs over 60,000 people. It is one of the six largest oil companies in the world.

In September 1879, the Pacific Coast Oil Company was created. They kept the name until 1906, when it merged with a Standard Oil subsidiary and became Standard Oil Company (California). Standard Oil of California and Gulf Oil merged in 1984, which became the largest merger in history at that time. The company would change its name to Chevron Corporation the same year.
