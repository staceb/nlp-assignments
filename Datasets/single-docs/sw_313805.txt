Doug Ashton

Douglas Joseph Ashton (19 November 1919 — 3 November 2011) was the owner of the world's longest family run circus, and the oldest surviving travelling circus. Ashton's Circus was started by Doug Ashton's great grandfather, Joseph Henry Ashton, in 1847. Doug Ashton was born into the circus and was on the road travelling when only six days old. Ashton, and his wife Phyllis, were both awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 1996 for their work for charity and the arts. He died in Perth, Western Australia, while travelling with his grandson's circus, Circus Joseph Ashton. Joseph Ashton trained Nicole Kidman to use the flying trapeze for Baz Lurhmann's movie, "Moulin Rouge!".
