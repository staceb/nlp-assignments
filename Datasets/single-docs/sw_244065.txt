It is assigned to access codes of 922, 923, 932 and 933. It began its operations in 2003, positioned as a latecomer in the market allowed it to put up infrastructure at lower cost.

Sun Cellular gained popularity because of its "24/7" offer of unlimited text messaging and calls for a fixed price for Sun-to-Sun transactions. This led competing networks Smart Communications and Globe Telecom to offer similar but higher-cost plans.

As of March 2010, Sun Cellular has 12 million subscribers.
