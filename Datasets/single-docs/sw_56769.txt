Tarzan's Treehouse

Tarzan's Treehouse is a walk-through attraction in Disneyland in Anaheim, California. It was originally called the Swiss Family Treehouse. The treehouse explores the past of the Disney character Tarzan. The tree is fake, but is considered by Disney imagineers a real species or "Disneyodendron eximus" which translates to "out of the ordinary Disney tree". The tree has 1,400 branches and 300,000 polyethlyne leaves. The tree is covered in live Spanish moss.
