ColecoVision

The ColecoVision was a second generation home video game console known mostly for its expansion packs including the Expansion Module #1 which gave it the largest library of games for its time by having compatibility with Atari 2600 games. The system competed with other game systems popular at the time such as Atari 2600 and the Intellivision. The ColecoVision offered arcade-quality graphics and gaming style, and the means to expand the system's basic hardware. River West Brands currently owns the ColecoVision brand name. It was released in 1982 and was discontinued in 1985.
