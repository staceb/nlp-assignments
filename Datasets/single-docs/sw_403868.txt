Al-Abbas brigade

The al-Abbas brigade (, or "Kata'ib al-Abbas") is a Shia militant group in Syria. It was formed in late 2011. Its leaders are Abu Ajeeb and Abu Hajar. Their main aim is to protect sensitive Shia holy sites and to help Bashar al-Assad's army during the Syrian Civil War. Its fighting style is mostly defensive.
