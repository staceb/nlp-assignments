Rayon

Rayon is a manufactured reconstituted cellulose fiber. It is made from purified cellulose. This is mainly from wood pulp, which is chemically changed into a soluble compound. It is then dissolved and forced through a spinneret to produce filaments. These are chemically solidified, resulting in man-made fibres of nearly pure cellulose. Because rayon is manufactured from naturally occurring polymers, it is considered a semi-synthetic fiber.
