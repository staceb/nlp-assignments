Maturity onset diabetes of the young

Maturity onset diabetes of the young, or MODY is any of several hereditary forms of diabetes mellitus caused by gene mutations. The mutations interfere with the making of insulin. MODY is often called monogenic diabetes. MODY 2 and MODY 3 are the most common forms of the disease.

The term "MODY" goes back to around 1964.

In MODY 2, oral medications or insulin may not be needed. In MODY 1 and MODY 3, insulin may be necessary.

Some people with MODY may be obese or overweight.
