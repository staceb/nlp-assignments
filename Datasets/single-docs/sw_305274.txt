Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day

Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day is a children's picture book written by Judith Viorst and illustrated by Ray Cruz. It was published in 1972 by Simon and Schuster. It is a humorous story about a boy named Alexander and how one day everything went wrong for him, so he started thinking of moving to Australia. But at the end, he realized that other people have bad days too, even in Australia. In 2011 Century Fox confirmed to make a live-action film based on the book but was later picked by The Walt Disney Company. In 2014, Disney released a film adaption, of the same name loosely based on the book.
