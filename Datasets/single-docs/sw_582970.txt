Beatrice Mintz

Beatrice Mintz (born January 24, 1921) is an American embryologist who has helped to the understanding of genetic modification, cellular differentiation and cancer, particularly melanoma.

Mintz was a pioneer of genetic engineering techniques, and was among the first scientists to generate both chimeric and transgenic mammals. 

Mintz was born on January 24, 1921 in New York City. She studied at New York University and at the University of Iowa.

In 1996 she shared the inaugural March of Dimes Prize in Developmental Biology with Ralph L. Brinster for their work in developing transgenic mice. Much of her career has been spent at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia where, in 2002, she was named to the Jack Schultz Chair in Basic Science. Mintz is a member of both the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Sciences.
