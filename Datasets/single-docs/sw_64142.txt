Ethane

Ethane is an organic chemical compound with chemical formula CH. 

At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colourless, odorless gas. It is isolated from natural gas, and as a byproduct of petroleum refining. 

Its main use is in the chemical industry, to make ethylene by steam cracking. 

At room temperature, the gas is flammable, and it explodes when mixed with air. When ethane is liquid, touching it causes a very serious frostbite.
