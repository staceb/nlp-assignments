Metropolitan Transportation Authority

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a government-chartered corporation that operates public transportation in the U.S. state of New York. The MTA runs buses and trains in 12 counties in southeastern New York. It also runs in two counties in southwestern Connecticut. On weekdays, about 11 million passengers use MTA buses and trains. Over 800,000 vehicles use its seven tolled bridges and two tunnels daily.

The MTA was chartered by the New York state government in 1965. In 1965, it was called the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (MCTA). The MTCA was made by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to buy and run the Long Island Rail Road, which run out of money. The MCTA became the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) in 1968. In 1968, it combined the operations of the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority (TBTA), which are now MTA New York City Transit (NYCT) and MTA Bridges and Tunnels (B&T). 

The MTA also took the lease of the Penn Central Transportation's Hudson, Harlem and New Haven commuter rail lines until 1976. In 1976, Conrail took over Penn Central. The MTA did not run these commuter rail lines by itself until 1983. In 1983, it formed the Metro-North Commuter Railroad from the Hudson, Harlem and New Haven lines.
