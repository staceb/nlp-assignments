Rudy Migay

Rudolph Joseph Migay (November 18, 1928 in Port Arthur, Ontario – January 16, 2016) was a Canadian retired professional ice hockey forward. He began playing in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 1949–50 NHL season and retired after the 1959–60 season, having never played with another team.

His brother-in-law, Pete Backor, was the first Stanley Cup winner of Slovak descent. He also was of Slovak descent, since both of his parents were born in what is today Slovakia.
