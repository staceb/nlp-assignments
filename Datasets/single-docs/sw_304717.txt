Bibliomania

Bibliomania can be a symptom of obsessive-compulsive disorder, by collecting of books to the point where social relations or health are in danger. It can be connected to stealing (kleptomania) of books.

Bibliomania is not to be confused with bibliophilia, which is the usual love of books.

Don Quixote may be the most famous bibliomaniac in fiction.
