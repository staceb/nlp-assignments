Zhoukoudian

Zhoukoudian or Choukoutien () is a cave system in Beijing, China. Many archaeological discoveries were found here, including one of the first specimens of "Homo erectus", dubbed Peking Man, and bones of the large hyena "Pachycrocuta brevirostris". The Peking Man lived in this cave about 200,000 to 750,000 years ago. 

The Peking Man Site was discovered by Johan Gunnar Andersson in 1921 and was first excavated by Otto Zdansky in 1921 and 1923 unearthing two human teeth.
