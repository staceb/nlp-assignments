Windows Update

Windows Update is a feature found in Microsoft Windows (after Windows 98) that lets the user update their copy of Windows. The Windows Update website can only be used with Internet Explorer.

It also allows updates to the definitions file of Windows Defender and to the Junk Mail filter in Windows Mail.

Microsoft Update is a feature in Windows Update that provides updates not only for Windows but also other Microsoft software (such as Microsoft Office).

Windows Update first became part of windows with the launch of Windows 98. Since then the Windows Update site has gone through many updates.

With the release of Windows Me a feature called Automatic Updates was added; this meant updates could be installed in the background.

In Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7, instead of using a Windows Update website you now use a application to receive your updates in windows.
