Bradycardia

Bradycardia (also called bradyarrhythmia) is a slow heart rate. In adults, bradycardia is defined as a heart rate that is under 60 beats per minute (bpm) while the person is resting. Bradycardia is a type of cardiac arrhythmia.

There are many types of bradycardia. Some are caused by problems with the heart. Bradycardia can also be caused by medicines, drugs, and many other things.

The symptoms of bradycardia depend on how slow the heart rate is and what kind of problem the heart is having. For most people, bradycardia is not a serious problem. But it can become a serious problem if it signals a major problem with the heart. Also, if bradycardia gets very bad, the heart will be unable to pump enough blood and oxygen to the body. Every part of the body needs blood and oxygen to survive. If bradycardia is bad enough, it can cause organ damage, brain damage, and death.
