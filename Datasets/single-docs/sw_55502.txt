Amphitheatre

An amphitheatre (or "amphitheater") is a type of structure. It is a flat area, surrounded by an area that ascends gradually. In the ascending area, people can be seated. Today, such structures are used for presentations, but also spectator sports. 

In Ancient Rome, these structures were used to entertain the population. Gladiator combats, athletics and executions were staged there.

A natural amphitheatre is a natural formation of rocks or cliffs, which resemble a man-made amphitheatre.
