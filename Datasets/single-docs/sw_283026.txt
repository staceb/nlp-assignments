Mileage

The term "mileage" refers to distance traveled. It often refers to distance per unit of fuel, such as miles per gallon (mpg) or litres per 100 kilometres (L/100 km). In the U.S., the fuel efficiency of motorized vehicles (such as cars, trucks, or motorcycles) is measured in mpg, as miles per U.S. gallon of gasoline. However, in the UK, the fuel efficiency is often measured in litres of fuel used per 100 kilometres, or in miles per imperial gallon.
