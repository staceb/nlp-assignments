Stereo Love

"Stereo Love" is a 2009 song recorded by Romanian musician Edward Maya featuring Vika Jigulina, released as his first single in late 2009 from his album "The Stereo Love Show". The refrain is from "Bayatılar", composed by Azerbaijani musician Eldar Mansurov. It became a worldwide hit in Nightclubs and rose to the top of Romanian, French, Dutch, Turkish, Finnish, Norwegian, Spanish, Swedish, and Irish singles charts.

The song and the music video were both included on the compilation "NRJ Music Awards 2010". The music video was filmed in Greece, as Edward Maya stated in an interview that Greece "was a place that I fell in love with". In 2011, the song was awarded as top dance song at the Billboard Music Awards.
