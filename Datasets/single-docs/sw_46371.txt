Psychonauts

Psychonauts is an action-adventure platformer video game created by Double Fine. It was made for the Xbox, Playstation 2, and PC, and was later brought to Xbox 360 through the Xbox Live Arcade service, and Apple Computers through Steam. The main character, Rasputin, is a Psychonaut, or psychic who travels through people's minds. Although Psychonauts initially did poorly regarding sales, the game is well known for being very creative and having a cult following. A sequel has recently been rumored to be developed by Double Fine and produced by Markus "Notch" Persson, millionaire, and creator of "Minecraft" and Mojang Studios. Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine, predicts "Psychonauts 2" to cost $13 million to make.
