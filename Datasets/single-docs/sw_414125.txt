Atari 7800

The Atari 7800 is a 8-bit video game console. It was competing with the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Sega Master System. It was Atari's third-to-last attempt to create another video game system that would be a successor to the Atari 2600. It was a short-lived success.

The Atari 7800 is backwards compatible with Atari 2600 games, but not Atari 5200 games. The Atari 7800 is also compatible with Atari 2600 controllers, such as the Atari Paddle controller and the Atari Joystick controller.
