The person on the recording admitted to past sexual abuse of a child. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) said Collins had been investigated by the department in 2012. That investigation happened after LAPD received a claim from forty years earlier regarding sexual abuse. The LAPD said they were not able to prove that the claim was true.
