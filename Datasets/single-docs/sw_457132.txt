Battle of the Wilderness

The Battle of the Wilderness was a battle of the American Civil War. It was the first battle of the Overland Campaign. It was fought from May 5 to 7, 1864. A Union army commanded by U.S. Grant started marching south to capture Richmond, Virginia. The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee, attacked Grant's army in an area called the Wilderness. After two days, Grant wasn't able to defeat Lee's army. He then decided to move the Union army southward to get between Lee and Richmond. This resulted in the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House.
