King's Men (playing company)

The King's Men was a company of actors. William Shakespeare belonged to it through most of his career. During the rule of Queen Elizabeth I, they were known as "The Lord Chamberlain's Men". They became "The King's Men" in 1603 when King James I had the throne and became the company's patron. All acting groups had to have a licence to perform, and the licence was usually owned by an important nobleman. Another company of actors at the time was "The Admiral's Men" supported by Lord Howe, the Lord High Admiral of England.
