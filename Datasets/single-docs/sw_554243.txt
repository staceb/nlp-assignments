Conventional weapon

Conventional weapons are those weapons that are not weapons of mass destruction. They can include weapons such as armoured fighting vehicles, armed helicopters, combat aircraft, artillery and warships. They can also include (but are not limited to) small arms, ammunition, cluster munitions and land mines. There is no single definition of conventional weapons. But they are the main weapons used in modern conventional warfare.

The United Nations set up the UN Register of Conventional Arms (UNROCA) in 1991. UN member nations add details of their imports and exports of conventional weapons. There are seven categories of conventional weapons in the register.
