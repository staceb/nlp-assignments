Harold Lloyd

Harold Clayton Lloyd, Sr. (April 20, 1893 – March 8, 1971) was an American actor and producer. Along with Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, Lloyd is remembered as one of the most popular and influential comedians of the silent movie years.

Harold Lloyd made nearly 200 movies. Many were without sound but later movies had sound.

His movies usually had "thrill" sections where Lloyd would be in fast chases and performed his own stunts. Lloyd did these dangerous stunts himself even though a movie accident had caused the loss of his right thumb and index finger.

Although Lloyd's movies were not as commercially successful as Chaplin's, Lloyd made a lot more money than Chaplin during their movie years. ($15.7 million to Chaplin's $10.5 million).

Lloyd died of prostate cancer.
