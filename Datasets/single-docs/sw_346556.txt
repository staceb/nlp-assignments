Delta Force

1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D) is a special forces unit of the United States Army. They are a highly secretive, highly elite unit that take part in very dangerous missions including counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, direct action, and more. Delta Force is highly elite in that it is not a unit that just anyone can apply for. Delta Force recruits primarily from the Army Special Forces (aka the Green Berets) and the 75th Ranger Regiment, themselves already elite special operations units.
