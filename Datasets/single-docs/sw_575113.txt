Tommy George Thompson (born November 19, 1941) is an American Republican politician. He was a state legislator in Wisconsin, and 42nd Governor of Wisconsin from 1987 to 2001.

Thompson is the longest serving governor in the state's history. During his term as governor he was the chairman of Amtrak, the nation's passenger rail service. He served as the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from 2001 through 2005, appointed by George W. Bush. 

After his time in the Bush Administration, Thompson was a partner with the law-firm Akin Gump and Chairman of Deloitte's global healthcare practice and has served on the board of 22 other organizations.

Thompson was a candidate for the U.S. Presidential election in 2008, though he withdrew from the race before the primaries. 

In 2012, he was the Republican nominee for the United States Senate seat in Wisconsin, hoping to replace retiring Democrat Herb Kohl, but was defeated by Tammy Baldwin, making it his first statewide loss.
