Abilene Ruff Riders

The Abilene Ruff Riders are an American football team. They play their games at the Taylor County Expo Center in Abilene, Texas. Their team colours are red, black and white. The team logo (the picture they have on their shirts) is a cowboy on a horse. They have a team mascot called Rowdy the Ruffrider, who is a cowboy too.

At first, the Ruff Riders were called the Katy Ruff Riders, because they played their games in a city called Katy, Texas. In 2008, they moved to Abilene and changed their name. They were part of the Intense Football League until 2010. For the 2010 - 2011 season, they were part of the Southern Indoor Football League, but now they are a part of the Lone Star Football League.
