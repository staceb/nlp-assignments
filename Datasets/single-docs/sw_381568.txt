10th Ward of New Orleans

The 10th Ward is a division of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana. The 10th Ward is one of the 17 Wards of New Orleans.

The 10th Ward is one of the city's Uptown wards, formerly the old Faubourg Lafayette annexed by New Orleans in 1850s.
The roughly wedge-shaped Ward stretches back from the Mississippi River. The lower boundary is Felicity Street, across which is the 1st Ward, then Martin Luther King Boulevard (formerly Melpomene Street), across which is the 2nd Ward. The upper boundary is First Street, across which lies the 11th Ward. 

Near the river the Ward includes part of the Lower Garden District and the former location of America's first experiment with large-scale public housing, started here in 1937, when, as part of the New Deal, President Roosevelt signed the loan to commence construction of the St. Thomas Housing Project. In Central City it includes the Oretha Castle Haley commercial district. 

The 10th Ward has been home to such notables as jazz musicians Buddy Bolden and George Brunies.
