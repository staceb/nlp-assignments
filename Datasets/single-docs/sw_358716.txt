Ballet blanc

A ballet blanc (literally, "white ballet") is a ballet in the style of the 19th century romantic ballet. The ballerinas and the female members of the "corps de ballet" wear bell-shaped, calf-length, white ballet tutus. The second acts of "La Sylphide" and "Giselle" are representatives of the "ballet blanc". Fokine's "Les Sylphides" is a 20th-century homage to the "ballet blanc".
