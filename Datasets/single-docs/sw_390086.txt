Takeshi's Castle

Takeshi's Castle was a Japanese game show. It aired from 1986 to 1990 on the Tokyo Broadcasting System. It involved players going through tough physical challenges given by Japanese actor Takeshi Kitano. Between 100 and 142 players competed in an episode. Episodes finished with a "Final Challenge" where the players who were left faced against Kitano. Here, players had to hit a paper ring or hit the sensor on Kitano's cart with a water gun. If a player did so, Kitano's cart was deactivated, the castle was "taken," and the player won the game. Winning players won one million yen. Only nine players won during the show's run.

The show has been shown in over 20 countries. Episodes would have an announcer of the country's language commenting on the action. It has become a popular show around the world.
