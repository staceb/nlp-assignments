Marree, South Australia

Marree is a small town in South Australia. The area was called Herrgott Springs by John McDouall Stuart who explored the area in 1859. He named them after one of his exploring group, David Herrgott, a Bavarian naturalist, who had found the artesian springs. The town was named Marree during World War One, because of ill feelings towards Germany. "Marree" was an Aboriginal word meaning "many possums."

The town is 685 km north of the state capital, Adelaide.
