Svensktoppen

Svensktoppen is a Swedish music chart on the radio. It was established in 1962. The chart has traditionally been dominated by dansband and schlager music, and lighter pop and rock music. In 2003, it allowed songs performed in English to be included. Since then, the chart became more oriented to modern pop and rock music.
