FARC

FARC (or FARC-EP) is the abbreviation of Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Ejército del Pueblo. This is the name of a guerrilla organisation operating in Colombia. The group says it has Marxist- Leninist roots. When the name of the group is translated into English, it usually reads "Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia – People’s Army".

The government of Colombia, the United States, Canada and the European Union<ref name="EU: Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001">Article 2(3) of Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 . Accessed February 20, 2008.</ref> have classified the organisation as a terrorist group. Other countries, such as Ecuador, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Cuba and Venezuela do not see the group as terrorist. They instead refer to the group as “insurgents”. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez, for example, publicly rejected this classification of "terrorists" in January of 2008. He called on Colombia and other world governments to recognize the guerrillas as a "belligerent force". Chávez said that if they were recognised that way, they would then be obliged to stop kidnappings and terror acts in order to respect the Geneva Conventions.
The FARC was established in the 1960s as the military wing of the Colombian Communist Party. The group started as a guerrilla movement. It became involved with trading illegal drugs during the 1980s. This caused an official separation from the Communist Party and the formation of a political structure it calls the Clandestine Colombian Communist Party. 
The FARC-EP still claims to be a guerrilla movement. According to the Colombian government, FARC has an estimated 6,000-8,000 members in 2008, down from 16,000 in 2001. Other estimates are higher, including up to 18,000 guerrillas, with the FARC themselves claiming in a 2007 interview that they have not been weakened. 
The FARC-EP is present in 15-20 percent of Colombia’s territory. Most of them are in southeastern jungles and in plains at the base of the Andes mountains.

In June 2016, the FARC signed a ceasefire accord with the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos in Havana. This accord was seen as a historic step to ending the war that has gone on for fifty years. On 25 August 2016, the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, announced that four years of negotiation had secured a peace deal with FARC and that a national referendum would take place on 2 October. The referendum failed with 50.24% voting against. The Colombian government and the FARC on November 24 signed a revised peace deal, which the Colombian Congress approved on November 30.

On 27 June 2017, FARC ceased to be an armed group, disarming itself and handing over its weapons to the United Nations.
