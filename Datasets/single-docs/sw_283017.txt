Murray-Darling Basin

The Murray-Darling Basin is an area in Australia around the Murray and Darling Rivers. Three million Australians inside and outside the basin are directly dependent on its water. 

About 6 per cent of Australia's total rainwater falls into the Murray-Darling Basin. About 85 per cent of all irrigation in Australia takes place in the basin, which supports an agricultural industry worth more than $9 billion per annum.

The Murray-Darling Basin covers or approximately one-seventh (14%) of the total area of Australia. 

Over two million people live in the Basin.
