Spanish Wells

Spanish Wells is one of the districts of the Bahamas. It is a small town on the island of St. George's Cay It is wide by long. About 1,500 people live here. Spanish Wells has a bridge to neighboring Russell Island. Spanish Wells is so small that many people get around the island using golf carts instead of full-sized cars. 

The area had a lot of property damage during a direct hit from Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and Floyd in 1999.
