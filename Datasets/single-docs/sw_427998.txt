Purchase order

A purchase order (PO) is a document stating the wish of a buyer to purchase something from a seller. It indicates all of the exact details of the goods the buyer intends to buy. When the seller accepts the purchase order, it forms a legal contract between both sides. This means that the seller is required to provide the goods in exchange for payment by the buyer.
