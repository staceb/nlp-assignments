Davis Cup

The Davis Cup is an annual tennis tournament. Countries from around the world compete against each other in teams.
Only the 16 best ranked teams take part. Teams play against each other in rounds or 'ties'. In each tie, 5 matches or 'rubbers' are played: four singles and one doubles match. The team to win the most matches (3 or more) is the winner and goes to the next round.
