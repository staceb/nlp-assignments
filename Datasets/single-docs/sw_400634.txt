Sága (goddess)

Sága is a goddess from Norse mythology. She is always associated with the island sakkavbar ("the fallen bank"). On this island, she and Odin often drank and ate together. Scholars have theorised that Sága may just be another name for Frigg. She may also be the goddess of clairvoyance or clarity.
