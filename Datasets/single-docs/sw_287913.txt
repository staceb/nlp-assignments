Borage

Borage, also known as starflower, is an annual herb.
The flowers are perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue in color, although pink flowers are sometimes examined. White flowered types are also grown.

As a fresh vegetable, borage, with a cucumber like taste, is often used in salads or as a garnish. The flower, which has the non-toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloid thesinine, has a sweet honey-like taste and as one of the few truly blue-colored eatable things, is often used to decorate dessert.
