Satyameva Jayate

"Satyameva Jayate" ( ""; lit. "Truth alone triumphs.") is a "mantra" from the ancient Indian scripture "Mundaka Upanishad". Upon independence of India, it was adopted as the national motto of India.
It is inscribed in script at the base of the national emblem. The emblem and the words "Satyameva Jayate" are inscribed on one side of all Indian currency. The emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka which was erected around 250 BCE at Sarnath, near Varanasi in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It is inscribed on all currency notes and national documents.
