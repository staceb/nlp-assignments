San (letter)

San (uppercase/lowercase Ϻ ϻ) was an old letter in the Greek alphabet that was used in some Greek cities before the alphabet got its classical standard form. It looked like the letter Mu (M), but was spoken like S. In the 6th century BC, people stopped using it and wrote Sigma (Σ) instead.
