Pope Stephen VII

Pope Stephen VII (??? − 15 March 931) was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from February 929 until 15 March 931 when he died. 

He was elected by Marozia from the Tusculani family, as a stop-gap measure until her own son John was ready. Before being elected, he was the cardinal-priest of St Anastasia in Rome.

He died on 15 March 931 in Rome and was succeeded by Pope John XI.
