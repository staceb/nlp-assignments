Piranha 3DD

Piranha 3DD is a 2011 movie directed by John Gulager taken from the subject by Alexandre Aja.
The movie is the sequel to "Piranha 3D". It stars Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd.

Is now one year after the attack of piranhas in Lake Victoria and everything now seems back to normal.
Instead, it turns out that not all piranhas are dead.
Lake Victoria has just opened a water park in the lake and the piranhas are hungry...

Fallon was seemingly dead in the first chapter.
Perhaps the movie is a reboot, or Fallon was not dead as it seemed.
