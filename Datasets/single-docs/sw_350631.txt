Simon Stevin

Simon Stevin (1548/49 – 1620) was a Flemish mathematician and military engineer. He translated many mathematical terms into Dutch. 

Stevin was born in Bruges, Flanders (now Belgium) around the year 1548. It is thought that Simon was a Calvinist. Very little has been recorded about his life. It is known that he left a widow with two children.

In Bruges there is a Simon Stevin Square which has his statue by Eugène Simonis.
