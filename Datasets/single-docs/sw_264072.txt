Innuendo

An innuendo is an indirect or implied statement of ideas or opinions. It can also be a remark or question, often disparaging (also called insinuation), that works indirectly by allusion. In the latter sense, the intention is often to insult or accuse someone in such a way that the words as used, taken literally, seem to be innocent in the direct meaning (but have a negative unspoken meaning).

An innuendo is "an oblique hint or remark"; The word is often used to express disapproval.

The term sexual innuendo has a specific meaning, namely that of a "risqué" "double sens" (double meaning) by playing on a possibly sexual meaning of an otherwise innocent statement.

Innuendo is a tool of bullying.
