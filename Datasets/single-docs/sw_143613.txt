Westminster School

The Royal College of St. Peter in Westminster, almost always known as Westminster School, is one of Britain's leading private schools. It has the highest number of students going to Oxford or Cambridge Universities of any secondary school or college (49.9%). It had the best GCSE results in 2013, with 98.16% of entries getting A* or A grades.

The school is near to Westminster Abbey in central London. It existed before the 12th century. The school's notable ex-students include Nick Clegg, Ben Jonson, Robert Hooke, Christopher Wren, Jeremy Bentham, and A. A. Milne. Boys enter the Westminster Under School when they are seven years old. They go to the main school when they are thirteen. Girls are allowed only at sixteen. The school has about 750 students. About a third are boarders (who live in the school). Most of the boarders go home for the weekends, after Saturday morning school. The school has eleven houses.

The school made Harris Westminster Sixth Form, a sixth form free school, with the Harris Federation in 2013. It opens in September 2014. It will give preference to applying students from poor backgrounds.
