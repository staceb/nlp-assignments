Puffball

A puffball is the common name for a member of several groups of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. Puffballs include the genera of "Calvatia", "Calbovista" and "Lycoperdon". All false puffballs are inedible, as they are tough and bitter to taste. The genus "Scleroderma", which has a young purple gleba, should be avoided.
