Huntingdon College

Huntingdon College, founded in 1854, is a liberal arts college in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. It is known for its business and science programs. The college has recently made a football team and marching band.

Huntingdon College was first started on February 2, 1854, as "Tuskegee Female College". A decision was made in the late 19th century to move the campus to a larger city. The college, renamed the "Woman's College of Alabama" moved in 1910 to a 58 acre section of Montgomery. Several new buildings were built for the "Gothic" style of the main college building, Flowers Memorial Hall.

The college admitted its first male student in 1934 and changed its name the next year to Huntingdon College in honor of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, a person who supported Methodism

Huntingdon is ranked a fourth school by "U.S. News and World Report". Huntingdon College is also ranked by the "Princeton Review" as one of the best liberal arts colleges in the Southeast.
