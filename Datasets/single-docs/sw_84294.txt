Religious debates over the Harry Potter series

Religious debates over the "Harry Potter" series of books by J. K. Rowling are usually because people say the books have occult or Satanic parts. These sayings come from some Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians. It also comes from Muslims who argue against the series.

A great number of people have replied to these claims. People who support the series say that the magic in "Harry Potter" is not really like occultism. They say it is more like fairy tales like "Cinderella" and "Snow White". They also suggest that it is more like the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien. Both writers are known for writing fantasy novels with Christian values. Some argue that the "Harry Potter" novels try hard not to discuss religion at all.

In the United States, people tried to get the books banned in schools. Their argument was that witchcraft is a registered religion, so letting the books in schools went against the separation of church and state. This then went to court to decide whether it was against the freedom of religion.

However, sometimes religion has supported the "Harry Potter" series. "At least as much as they've been attacked from a theological point of view", says Rowling, "[the books] have been lauded (praised) and taken into pulpit, and most interesting and satisfying for me, it's been by several different faiths".
