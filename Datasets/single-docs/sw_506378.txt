LED lamp

A LED lamp is a product that uses a Light-emitting diode and that is assembled into a lamp or a light bulb. LED lamps last much longer, and are more efficient than incandescent lamps. Many LED lamps are also better than fluorescent lamps. 

Unlike fluorescent lamps, most LED lamps do not need to "warm up" before they emit the full amount of light.
