Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi

The Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi, (simplified Chinese: 汉语水平考试; traditional Chinese: 漢語水平考試; hanyu pinyin: Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì), shortened as HSK, is the People's Republic of China's only standardized test of Standard Mandarin Chinese proficiency for non-native speakers, such as foreign students, overseas Chinese, and members of ethnic minority groups in China. It is also known as the "Chinese Proficiency Test".

Every year, HSK certificates are issued to those who score well enough. The HSK is primarily conducted in Simplified Chinese.
