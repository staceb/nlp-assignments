Snoop Dogg

Calvin Cordozar Broadus, Jr. (born October 20, 1971), known by his stage names Snoop Doggy Dogg, Snoop Dogg, and later Snoop Lion, is an American rapper, singer-songwriter, and actor.

The reason why he is called "Snoop Dogg" is because his mother named him after a character called "Snoopy", because Snoop Dogg was a fan of the "Peanuts" cartoon, which has the Snoopy character.

In 2012, Snoop Dogg went to Jamaica. He studied the Rastafari movement. He changed his name to Snoop Lion, after the Lion of Judah. This is a name from the tribe of Judah. It is sometimes used to describe Haile Selassie, who is worshipped by Rastafarians. His 2013 album, "Reincarnated", is his first reggae music album.
