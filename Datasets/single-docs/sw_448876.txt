Transglutaminase

A transglutaminase is an enzyme that forms a chemical bond between two protein molecules. The reaction also produces a molecule of ammonia. Transglutaminases were first described in 1959. In 1968 it was discovered they form a role in blood coagulation.

Transglutaminase have many uses. They can be used as a binding agent to improve the texture of protein-rich foods such as surimi or ham. Other examples of foods made using transglutaminase include imitation crabmeat, and fish balls.
