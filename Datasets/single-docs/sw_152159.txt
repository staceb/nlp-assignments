Ogenne-Camptort

Ogenne-Camptort is a commune of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques "département" in the southwestern part of France. It is made up of two ancient (very old) French towns: Camptort and Ogenne. They were combined (made into one) on May 12, 1841.

According to Pierre de Marca, a famous historian, the name "Ogenne" can be traced back to the 11th century. It was first called "Ogene" in the 11th century, then "Oiena" in the 13th century. In around 1350 it was called "Sent-Jacme d'Ojenne", and in 1385 it was called "Oyene." Finally in 1548 it was called "Ogena".

The name "Camptort" comes from the 13th century. It was first called "Campus tortus" in 1235. It was called some other names: "Cam-tort" (1385), "Quamptort" (1540), "Sanctus Stephanus de Camptort" (1674), "Cantor" (1755), and "Camptor" (1793.)

Two streams run through the town. One stream is the Saley, a tributary of the Gave d'Oloron (a river). The other stream is the Laà, a tributary of the Gave de Pau (also a river.)
