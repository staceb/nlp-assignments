Alexander Cools

Alexander ("Lex") Rudolf Cools (The Hague, 1941 – Nijmegen, 7 September 2013) was a Dutch neuroscientist. He was interested in the pharmacology of behavior. 

Cools got his Doctor of Philosophy in 1973 at the Radboud University Nijmegen. He was a professor in Nijmegen from 1985 until his retirement in 2006. 

A special issue of the scientific journal "Behavioural Pharmacology" was dedicated to his memory in 2014. Cools was one of the founders of the European Behavioural Pharmacology Society. He became its second president. He received that society's Distinguished Achievement Award in 2003. 

Cools was the first to propose (1976) the existence of different types of dopamine receptors. This claim is correct but was initially not believed. Cools is also known for his work on the basal ganglia.
