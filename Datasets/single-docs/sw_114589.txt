School of Rock

School of Rock is a 2003 American musical comedy movie starring Jack Black.

Dewey Finn (Black) has been kicked out of his band. His roommate is a substitute teacher. Finn finds one of his requests for a private school and goes in his roommate's place as he needs the money for rent. He soon finds out that the school, in Woodbury, New York, has music lessons, so he enlists the class to become his band. They plan to perform at Battle of the Bands. However, his roommate's girlfriend finds out that Finn was impersonating her boyfriend and gets him kicked off the job. Finn is down until the kids get their own school bus, pick Finn up, and play at the concert. The band loses to another one, but Finn establishes a school for rock, and the kids come over to his place to take lessons.

On July 14, 2008 the "School of Rock 2" sequel was confirmed. In 2012, Jack Black said that a sequel is unlikely.
