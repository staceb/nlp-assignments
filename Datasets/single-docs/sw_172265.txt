Hurricane Gert (1999)

Hurricane Gert was the fourth of five major hurricanes in the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season. It formed on September 11 of the coast of Africa. It reached its greatest strength on September 15, when its winds were at 150 mph (240 km/h). It gradually curved northwest and then north, passing a short distance east of Burmuda. The hurricane's center did not make landfall, but it did cause many poweroutages.

On September 23, Gert became an extratropical storm as it turned northeast and became absorbed into another storm system. While it passed southeast of Atlantic Canada, strong waves hit Newfoundland which caused heavy marine damage.
