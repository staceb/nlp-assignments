John Burgoyne

John Burgoyne (24 February 1722 – 4 August 1792) was a general in the British Army. In 1777, he led the British troops in the Battle Of Saratoga where he surrendered to American general Horatio Gates. This success led to France and Spain recognizing the United States and offering aid to the continental army. Historians consider this to be the turning point for the American Revolutionary War.
