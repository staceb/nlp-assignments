Hypostatic model of personality

The hypostatic model of personality is a way of viewing the many sides of a person's character. The model says that a person can behave and appear to others in many ways, depending on how that person is, but also on how someone looks at that person. It says that people are not one-sided, but are a little bit of everything. For example, today someone can be mean, and tomorrow he can be good. How someone appears also depends on things and people around him or her. For example, sometimes the most coward person may become the greatest hero, if he is called to save someone's life. All these "sides" of a person have to be known by scientists so they can change them for the better.
