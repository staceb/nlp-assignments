The construction began in 1988. It was finished in 1991. It was the tallest building in Europe, between 1991 and 1997. In 1997, Commerzbank Tower became the tallest building in Germany. It was only two metres higher than MesseTurm. The construction of the building's foundation set a world record. The world record was for the longest continuous concrete pour. Ninety trucks poured concrete for 78 hours. They poured it into the deep foundation.

There is a pyramid on the very top of MesseTurm. It is tall. This makes it very different from other skyscrapers. Because of this shape, people in Germany often call it "The Pencil."
