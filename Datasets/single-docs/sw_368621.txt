Bangladesh is used to move narcotics made in neighboring countries. A 2007 report said that Bangladesh is now the main point for the movement and trafficking of heroin from Southeast Asia to the European market . 

A total of 10,331 homicides were reported from 2001 to 2003. This is a large increase.

For the Asia Pacific region, Bangladesh is ranked as one of the main countries for software piracy. It is believed that software vendors lose around 102 million US dollars every year to this black market trade. There is no strict law to stop this practice.

In 2011 Bangladesh was ranked 120th for corruption in a list of 182 countries. This means there appears to be a high amount of corruption in the country.
