History of computer and video games

Video games were introduced as an entertainment medium in 1971, becoming the start for a big entertainment industry in the late 1970s/early 1980s in the United States, Japan, and Europe. After a bad industry collapse in 1983 and a rebirth two years later, the video game industry has experienced large growth for over twenty years. Now, it is a $10 billion industry and it earns almost as much money as the motion picture industry.
Nowadays, we have companies such as Sony, PlayStation, and Nintendo that are very popular in most countries.
