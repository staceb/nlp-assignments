The iPad did not get multitasking until iOS 4.2 was released in November 2010. Multitasking is currently supported on iPhone 3GS or newer, iPod Touch 3rd generation or newer, and all iPad models.

Users can use fast app switching by opening the multitasking bar. The multitasking bar can be displayed by double-tapping the home button.
