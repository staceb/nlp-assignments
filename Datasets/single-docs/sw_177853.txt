Alaska Range

The Alaska Range is a series of mountains in Alaska, in the United States. The mountain range stretches about from northwest to southeast. The United States' highest mountain, Denali (20,320' or 6,194 m) is in the Alaska Range.

Many glaciers are in the Alaska Range, including the Canwell, Castner, Black Rapids, Susitna, Yanert, Muldrow, Eldridge, Ruth, Tokositna, and Kahiltna Glaciers.

Through the Alaska Range runs four major rivers, which are the Delta, Nenana, Nabesna, and Chisna Rivers. The Nenana River is a popular destination for whitewater rafting in Alaska.
