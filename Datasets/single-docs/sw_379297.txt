South Pole–Aitken basin

The South Pole–Aitken basin is a huge impact crater on the far side of Earth's Moon. Roughly in diameter and deep, it is one of the largest known impact craters in the Solar System. It is the largest, oldest and deepest basin on the Moon. The formation of the large lunar basins occurred before 3.8 billion years ago.

This moon basin was named after two features on opposing sides; the crater Aitken on the northern end and the southern lunar pole at the other end.
