Imperial was formed indirectly by Prince Albert. Under his guidance, the Crown bought land in South Kensington to establish educational and cultural institutions. The area was referred to as "Albertopolis" by sceptics. The area included the Natural History Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Science Museum, the Royal Albert Hall and the Imperial Institute. The Imperial Institute was opened by Queen Victoria, who laid the first brick.
