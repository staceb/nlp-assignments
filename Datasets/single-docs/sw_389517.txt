Costa Rican people

Costa Ricans, ("costarricenses" in Spanish) are also called ticos. They are from a multiethnic Spanish speaking nation in Central America. It is called Costa Rica. Costa Ricans do not consider their nationality one ethnicity. This is because there are many ethnic backgrounds. Costa Ricans are mostly criollos, castizos and mestizos. There are four small minority groups: Mulattos, Blacks, Amerindians and Asians.

The 2011 Census states Costa Rica has a population of 4,301,712 people.
