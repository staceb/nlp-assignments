Golden Spikes Award

The Golden Spikes Award is given out every year to the best beginning baseball player in the United States. The award, created by USA Baseball and sponsored by the Major League Baseball Players Association, was first presented in 1978. It is given to a beginning player who best exhibits and combines "exceptional on-field ability and excellent sportsmanship." The award is considered the most important in beginning baseball.
