Sibley-Monroe checklist 1

The Sibley-Monroe checklist was a landmark document in the study of birds conducted by Charles Sibley and Burt Monroe during the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s. It drew on extensive DNA-DNA hybridisation studies to reassess the relationships between modern birds.

There are species on the checklist.
