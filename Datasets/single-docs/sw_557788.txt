Vulnicura

Vulnicura is the ninth studio album by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk released in March 2015. The album deals the break-up with her long-time partner Matthew Barney chronologically. The name Vulnicura is a latin word that means "Cure for wounds".

The album was produced by Björk, Venezuelan producer Arca and British producer The Haxan Cloak. To promote the album, Björk embarked in the Vulnicura Tour. No song was released as promotional single.

It received universal acclaim from music critics and drew comparison to Björk previous albums Homogenic (1997) and Vespertine due to its instrumentation (strings and electronic beats) as well as its lyrical content.

Two different versions of the album were released during 2015 and 2016: Vulnicura Strings, which feature all the songs with new string arrangements, and Vulnicura Live, featuring Live versions of the album tracks as well as songs from her previous albums with new arrangements.
