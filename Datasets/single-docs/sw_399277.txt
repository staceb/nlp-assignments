Sassarese language

Sassarese (local name "Sassaresu" or "Turritanu") is a Romance language. It is related to the Corsican language and the Sardinian language. It is also related to Gallurese. The latter is regarded as a Corsican dialect despite the geographic location, although this attribution is a matter of controversy. It can be considered a transitional language between Italo-Dalmatian languages 

Sassarese is spoken by approximately 120,000 people in the northwest coastal areas of Sardinia, Italy.
