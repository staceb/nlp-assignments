"Writing's on the Wall" received mixed reviews, especially when compared to other Bond theme songs. The mixed reception to the song led to Shirley Bassey being a popular topic on Twitter on the day it was released. 

The single became the first Bond movie theme to reach number 1 in the UK Singles Chart. It also reached the Top 10 in a few other European countries. Unlike other James Bond themes, it was not as successful outside Europe. It only peaked at Number 43 in Canada and Australia and Number 71 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.
