Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant

The Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant is a nuclear power plant in Iran. It is about southeast of the city of Bushehr. It is between the fishing villages of Halileh and Bandargeh along the Persian Gulf.

The power plant was first planned back in the 1970s. German companies started the work in 1975, but stopped in 1979. Later, Russia took over the planning. The governments of Iran and Russia agreed to build the nuclear plant. It costs about $800 million.

The Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant is now Iran's first nuclear power plant. It was first filled with nuclear material on 21 August 2010.
