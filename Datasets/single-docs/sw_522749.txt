25 (Adele album)

25 is the third studio album by English singer-songwriter Adele. It was released on November 20, 2015. There are eleven tracks on the album. The lead single from the album, "Hello", was released on October 23, 2015. It reached number one in the UK, US, Canada, and Australia. It was number one across Europe including Germany, France, Russia and Italy. It hit number ten in Japan. "25" marks Adele's return to music after her recording of the Bond theme "Skyfall" in 2012, along with the birth of her son Angelo that year. She has worked with producers who have worked with Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Britney Spears, and Taylor Swift. She also worked with Bruno Mars on the song "All I Ask". Five other songs charted from the album on the "Billboard" Hot 100, even though they were not released as singles at the time. They were "Send My Love (To Your New Lover)", "When We Were Young", "Remedy", "All I Ask", and "Water Under the Bridge".

"25" has officially broken the record for the most albums sold in a week in the US by selling 3.38 million copies. It has gone on to sell over 4 million copies in the US alone after only two weeks of release. The album has been certified Diamond in the United States for sales and streams of more than 10 million copies in that country alone. The album was not made available on streaming sites such as Spotify and Apple Music. On November 20, 2016, a year after "25" was released, "Billboard" reported that the album sold over 9.1 million copies in the US alone, not including any streams of the album.

Adele has stated that "25" was a "make-up record," compared to her previous album, "21", being a "breakup record." The song "Sweetest Devotion" was written about her son Angelo, who was born in October 2012.

On December 14, 2015, "Billboard" said that "When We Were Young" has been chosen as the second single from "25". When this was announced, the song had charted as high as number 22 on the "Billboard" Hot 100 and reached number 14. It has been certified Platinum in the United States.
