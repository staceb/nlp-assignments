Seal of Wisconsin

The Great Seal of the State of Wisconsin is the state seal of the U.S. state of Wisconsin. 

The seal has the words "Great Seal of the State of Wisconsin" at its top. At the bottom, it has a cornucopia alongside bars of lead, above 13 stars, one for each of the original 13 states. Also at the top is "Forward", the state motto, and a badger. There are a sailor and a miner to represent mining and shipping, which were major industries when Wisconsin was established. On the four corners of the shield are a plough, a pick and shovel, an arm and hammer, and an anchor. In the center of the shield is the United States shield with the motto E Pluribus Unum. 

The state flag features the state seal on a blue background.
