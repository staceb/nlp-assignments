Calf roping

Calf roping is a sport where a person chases a calf on horseback. The person ropes the calf, then jumps off their horse and ties the calf's one front foot and two hind feet with a "piggin' rope". Then they must give the calf some slack and the rope must stay tied for 6 seconds.

Calf roping started with cowboys. They had to rope and tie down calves to brand them and doctor them.
