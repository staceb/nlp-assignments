Dan Coats

Daniel Ray "Dan" Coats (born May 16, 1943) is an American politician. Coats is the 5th and current Director of National Intelligence serving since March 15, 2017. He served as United States Senator from Indiana from 1989 to 1999 and 2011 to 2017. He is a member of the U.S. Republican Party. He was in the United States House of Representatives from 1981 to 1989.

In March 2015, Coats announced his retirement and said he would not run for re-election in 2016. He was replaced by Republican Todd Young.

On January 5, 2017, Coats was nominated by President Elect Donald Trump for Director of National Intelligence, succeeding James R. Clapper.

Coats was born on May 16, 1943 in Jackson, Michigan. He studied at Wheaton College in Illinois and at Indiana University, Indianapolis. 

From 1976 to 1980, Coats worked for then-U.S. Representative Dan Quayle, a Republican from Indiana's 4th congressional district, as Quayle's district representative. When Quayle decided to challenge three-term Democratic incumbent Birch Bayh in the 1980 U.S. Senate election, Coats ran for and won Quayle's seat in the U.S. House.

When Quayle resigned from the Senate after being elected Vice President of the United States in 1988, Coats was appointed to Quayle’s former seat. Coats was subsequently elected to the seat in 1990 and 1992 and served in the Senate until January 1999, when Evan Bayh became the new Senator. Coats announced on February 3, 2010, he would run for his old Senate seat and on February 16, 2010, Bayh announced his intention to retire. Coats went on to win that Senate seat. 

Coats announced in March 2015 that he would not run for re-election in 2016.

From August 15, 2001, to February 28, 2005, Coats was the United States Ambassador to Germany. As ambassador during the lead-up to the Iraq war, he pressured the German government not to oppose the war, threatening worsened US relations with Germany. As Ambassador he also played a critical role in establishing robust relations with then opposition leader Angela Merkel and in the construction of a new United States Embassy in the heart of Berlin next to the Brandenburg Gate.

On January 5, 2017, then-President-elect of the United States Donald Trump nominated Coats to serve as Director of National Intelligence. The United States senate confirmation hearing was held on February 28, 2017. His nomination was confirmed by the senate with a 85-12.

Coats is married to Marsha Coats. They have three children. Coats lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana.
