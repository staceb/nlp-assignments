Brooke Shields

Brooke Christa Camille Shields (born May 31, 1965) is an American actress and supermodel. She has been named one of People's most beautiful people in the world three times. Shields started being a model when she was 11 months old. Ford Models started their children's division for Shields. She first acted in "Alice, Sweet Alice", a 1976 slasher film. Her next film was "Pretty Baby". In it she played a child prostitute called Violet. She was 12 when it was released and was naked in the film. Some people said this was child pornography and Shields got a lot of attention from this. In February 1980 she was the youngest model ever to be on the cover of Vogue (magazine). She was 14. Later that year she was in adverts for Calvin Klein jeans. In 1981, she starred in The Blue Lagoon.

In 1985 a book Shields wrote about her life, "On Your Own" was published.

In 1987 Shields got a degree from Princeton University in French literature.

From 1996 to 2000, Shields was the main character in the sitcom "Suddenly Susan".

On April 19, 1997, Shields married Andre Agassi. She later married Chris Henchy with whom she has two daughters.

On July 7, 2009 Shields gave a speech at Michael Jackson's memorial service. Jackson and Shields met when she was 13. They became friends instantly. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shields said, “There were times when he would ask me to marry him, and I would say, ‘You have me for the rest of your life, you don’t need to marry me, I’m going to go on and do my own life and have my own marriage and my own kids, and you’ll always have me’.”

In his 1993 interview with Oprah, Jackson said that he was dating Shields. However, in the 2009 Rolling Stone interview Shields said the last time she saw Jackson was 1990.
