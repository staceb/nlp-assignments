IGN rated the game a 7.1 out of 10, saying it had "some great control mechanics and inventive level work" 

GameSpot gave the game a 6.4 out of 10 and said "The game certainly contains a lot of the same Wario charm that makes his GBA appearances so memorable, but the final product is too short and simplistic to hold your attention for more than a day."
