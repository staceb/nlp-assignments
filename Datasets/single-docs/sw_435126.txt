Swell Radio

Swell Radio is a mobile radio streaming application. It learns what kind of radio stations the user likes based on listening to behaviour, community filtering and an algorithm. It was originally designed for use while going to and coming from work. The service focuses on delivering spoken-word audio content to users.

The app is available on iOS devices worldwide but content is customized to the United States and Canada. The application does not have any advertisements.

Concept.io, creator of Swell Radio, raised $5.4 million in Series A Funding led by venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. The application originally launched the application on the iOS platform in Canada in early 2013 and officially launched in the United States on June 27, 2013.
