Aglaophyton

Aglaophyton is a genus of early Devonian fossil land plants. Its fossils have been found in the Rhynie chert. Only the sporophyte generation have been found as fossils. Only one species has been found, "Aglaophyton major". 

"Aglaophyton" was at first thought to be a species of the vascular plant genus "Rhynia" which lived at the same time. Later it was discovered that it is not really a vascular plant. It had vascular tissue, but the cells had thin walls. It might therefore be a missing link between the Bryophytes and "Horneophyton" and the vascular plants like "Rhynia".

In 2004, Crane et al. published a cladogram which has "Aglaophyton" as the sister group of the vascular plants.
