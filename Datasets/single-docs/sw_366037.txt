Scafell Pike

Scafell Pike is the highest mountain in England. It is tall. It is located in Lake District National Park, in Cumbria.

It is sometimes confused with the near-by Scafell. The name "Pikes of Sca Fell" was first used to mean the peaks now known as Scafell Pike, Ill Crag and Broad Crag. The contraction "Scafell Pike" started as an error on an Ordnance Survey map.

The summit was given to the National Trust in 1919 by Lord Leconfield. He did this in memory of the men of the Lake District "who fell for God and King, for freedom, peace and right in the Great War".
