Wilfred Grenfell

Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell, KCMG (28 February 1865 – 9 October 1940) was a doctor and medical missionary to Newfoundland and Labrador. In 1892 Grenfell was sent to Newfoundland. He brought the first medical services to Newfoundland and Northern Labrador. In addition to practicing medicine, Dr. Grenfell built hospitals, schools and orphanages. These served the Eskimos, natives and fishermen of Newfoundland. For his years of service to the people of these communities he was later knighted (Order of St Michael and St George). 

The Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell Historical Society was formed in 1978. The society purchased Grenfell's home in St. Anthony, Newfoundland and Labrador. The home has been restored as a museum and archives.
