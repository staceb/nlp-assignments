The Shock of the Lightning

"The Shock of the Lightning" is the first single off English rock band Oasis' seventh and final studio album "Dig Out Your Soul". The song was released in 22 September 2008 as a download and on 29 September 2008 as a physical copy. 

Lead guitarist Noel Gallagher said of the song: "If 'The Shock of the Lightning' sounds instant and compelling to you, it's because it was written dead fast. And recorded dead fast. 'The Shock of the Lightning' basically is the demo. And it has retained its energy. And there's a lot to be said for that, I think. The first time you record something is always the best"

NME ranked the song #96 on their list of "100 Tracks of the Decade".
