Protocarnivorous plant

A protocarnivorous plant is a plant that traps small animals (usually insects and arthropods) much like carnivorous plants do. Unlike carnivorous plants, these plants cannot get the nutritients from the trapped prey, though. The mechanisms of trapping are very similar to those developed by carnivorous plants. The problem is also one of definitions, as people do not agree what makes a "carnivorous plant".
