Pope Adeodatus II

Pope Adeodatus II (??? − 17 June 676), also known as Deodatus II, was pope of the Roman Catholic Church from 11 April 672 until he died in 676. 

Very little information is known about him but most surviving records say that he was known for being generous, especially when it came to the poor and to pilgrims. He was a Benedictine. He was already an elderly man when he was elected pope and did not really accomplish much during his four year reign as pope.
