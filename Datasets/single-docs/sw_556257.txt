Superalloy

A superalloy, or high-performance alloy, is a metal alloy that has several key characteristics. These include excellent resistance to high temperatures and corrosion or oxidation. The term was first used after World War II. They were developed for use in jet engines and gas turbines. About 75% of superalloys are used in aerospace engineering.
