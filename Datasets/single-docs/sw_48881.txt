Shear stress

Shear stress is a stress state where the stress is parallel to the surface of the material, as opposed to normal stress when the stress is to the surface. 

Shear stress is relevant to themotion of fluids upon surfaces, which result in the generation of shear stress.
Also constructions in soil can fail due to shear; e.g., the weight of an earth-filled dam may cause the subsoil to collapse, like a small landslide.
