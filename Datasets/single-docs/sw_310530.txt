The bleeding had caused Vergeer to pass out. Vergeer had the blood removed. Six weeks later she went home. Yet the next year in June Vergeer had more headaches. She also had pressure behind the eyes and pain in her neck. The doctors could not find what was wrong. They sent her home. In October, doctors found Vergeer to be bleeding in her head again. They drained the blood. The doctors also found that Vergeer had an Vascular myelopathy. This abnormality caused the strokes that Vergeer experienced.
