Oliver Ellsworth

Oliver Ellsworth (April 29, 1745 – November 26, 1807) was an American lawyer and politician. He was against British rule, a drafter of the United States Constitution, United States Senator from Connecticut, and the third Chief Justice of the United States. 

While at the Federal Convention, Ellsworth moved to strike the word "National" from the motion made by Edmund Randolph of Virginia. Randolph had moved successfully to call the government the "National Government of United States". Ellsworth moved that the government should continue to be called the "United States Government".
