Preamplifier

Preamplifier is a type of electronic amplifier. It doesn't have enough power to feed speakers. Rather a preamplifier amplifies weak signals, for example from a microphone, for electronic processing or distribution. 

Early preamplifiers used vacuum tubes. Since the 1960s, most electronic amplifiers have been built with transistors. Transistors are lighter, less expensive, and more reliable.
