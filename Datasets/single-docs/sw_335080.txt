Port

A port is a place at the edge of an ocean, river, or lake for ships to load and unload their cargo. Persons on ships can get on or off ships at a port. It is also called a harbour or harbor. This kind of port is the same as sea port.

A good port is easy to get to over water or land. It is also in a place that is not easily hurt by bad weather, like strong wind or big waves. 

Some ports are important for trade; other ports are important to a country's navy.

If a port is visited by ships that can go on the ocean, it is called a "sea port" or just a "port". If a port is visited only by river boats like barges, it is called a "river port".

If a port is on a lake, river, or canal that goes to a sea or ocean, that port can be called an "inland port".
