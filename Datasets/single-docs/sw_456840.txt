Anglican Church of Canada

The Anglican Church of Canada is the member church of the Anglican Communion in Canada. In 2007, it had over 545,000 members in 1,676 parishes. It is the third largest church in Canada, after the Roman Catholic Church and the United Church of Canada.

English settlers brought the Church of England with them when they settled Canada in the 1500s. Until the 1830s, the Canadian church was completely under the control of the Church of England: the Church of England appointed all Canadian bishops and all funding for the Canadian church came from the British parliament.
