Otto Lilienthal

Otto Lilienthal was a German pioneer of aviation who became the first person to make repeated successful gliding flights.

On August 9, 1896, his glider stalled and he was unable to regain control. Falling from about 15 m (50 ft), he broke his neck and died the next day, 10 August, 1896.
