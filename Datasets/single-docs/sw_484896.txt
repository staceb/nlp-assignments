Independence (mathematical logic)

In mathematical logic, a sentence is independent from a first-order theory, if that theory cannot be used to prove the sentence as true or false. Sometimes, people also talk about the sentence being "undecidable", but this has nothing to do with the notion of decidability as in solving a decison problem.
