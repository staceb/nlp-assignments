Leeds Town Hall

Leeds Town Hall is a large town hall in the City of Leeds, West Yorkshire. The town hall is on The Headrow, a large street in the city centre. The town hall was designed by Cuthbert Brodrick. Building began in 1853 and was finished in 1858, when it was opened by Queen Victoria. When Leeds Civic Hall opened in 1933, the council moved their offices into the new hall. Today the town hall is mostly used for concerts.

Leeds town hall was the tallest building in Leeds until 1966 when the Park Plaza Hotel was built on City Square.

The town hall and the Great Hall at the University of Leeds are the venues for the Leeds International Pianoforte Competition.

The town hall was one of the favourite buildings of poet, John Betjemin and in 2008 was voted in the top-ten favourite town halls in the United Kingdom (nearby Halifax Town Hall also listed).
