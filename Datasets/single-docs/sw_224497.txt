Harbor seal

The harbor seal ("Phoca vitulina"), also called the common seal, is a true seal. They are found in coastal waters of the northern Atlantic and Pacific ocean as well as Baltic and North Seas making them the most wide-ranging of the pinnipeds (walruses, eared seals, and true seals).

The females live longer than the males and females usually live to be 30 to 35, while males usually live up to 20 or 25 years old.
