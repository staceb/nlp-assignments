Flamsteed designation

Flamsteed designations are for stars that are similar to Bayer designations. However, they use numbers instead of Greek letters. Flamsteed designation contained 2554 stars.

The numbers are usually assigned in the order of increasing right ascension within each constellation. However, because of the effects of precession, they are now slightly out of order in some parts. This method first appeared in John Flamsteed's "Historia Coelestis Britannica", a book that was published by Edmond Halley and Isaac Newton together in 1712.
