Yothu Yindi

Yothu Yindi was the first major indigenous band in Australia. They released many hits and albums such as "One Blood", "Treaty", "Garma", "Homeland Movement" and "Birrkuda". The name Yothu Yindi translates from 'yolngo matha' to English as "child and mother". This term refers to the connection the tribe has to their land.

Some of their achievements include spending 22 weeks in the national charts for their single "Treaty", the prime minister Paul Keating awarded them with $30000.
