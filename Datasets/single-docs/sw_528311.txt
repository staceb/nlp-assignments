Rose Chibambo

Rose Lomathinda Chibambo (8 September 1928 – 12 January 2016) was a known British-born Malawi politician and activist. She was the Protectorate of Nyasaland in the years leading up to independence as the state of Malawi in 1964, and immediately after. 

She was imprisoned in 1959, while pregnant with her 5th child, along with other Malawians whom the Federal government felt were a threat to British rule. After Malawi gained independence, Chibambo was the first woman minister in the new cabinet. She was forced into exile for thirty years, returning after the restoration of democracy.

On 1 January 2012, she was honored by being place on Malawi’s 200 Kwacha banknote.

Chibambo died from a heart attack at a hospital in Blantyre, Malawi at the age of 87.
