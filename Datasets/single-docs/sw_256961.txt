I Want You (She's So Heavy)

"I Want You (She's So Heavy)" is a song by The Beatles from their album "Abbey Road". It was written by John Lennon, although it is credited to Lennon/McCartney.

The song is an unusual Beatles song for many reasons, its length (nearly eight minutes), small number of lyrics (only fourteen different words are sung), three-minute descent through the same repeated guitar chords, and sudden ending. It is also one of the last songs that the Beatles mixed as a group, on August 20, 1969.
