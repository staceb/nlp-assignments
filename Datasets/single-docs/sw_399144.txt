Marcheline Bertrand

Marcia Lynne "Marcheline" Bertrand (May 9, 1950 – January 27, 2007) was an American actress and producer. She also co-founded the All Tribes Foundation, to culturally and economically benefit Native Americans, and the Give Love Give Life organization, to raise public awareness of women's cancers. She was the mother of Angelina Jolie.

She was born at St. Francis Hospital in Blue Island, Illinois. Bertrand was brought up in the nearby small town of Riverdale. Her parents were Lois June (nee Gouwens; 1928–1973) and Rolland F. Bertrand (1923–1985). She had two younger siblings: a sister, Debbie, and a brother, Raleigh. Her father was of French Canadian ancestry, while her mother was of Dutch and German ancestry. She also claimed to be of Iroquois ancestry, although her only known Native American ancestor was a Huron woman born in 1649. According to her daughter, actress Angelina Jolie, Bertrand was often wrongly identified as a French actress, with Jolie saying, "My mom is as far from French Parisian as you can get. She grew up in a bowling alley that my grandparents owned." In 1965, Bertrand's family moved from the Chicago area to Beverly Hills, California. She attended Beverly Hills High School from sophomore year through graduation.

She was married to Jon Voight from 1971 until they divorced in 1980. She was partners with Bill Day from 1978 until they separated in 1989. Then she was partners with John Trudell until her death in 2007. She had two children; Angelina Jolie and James Haven with Voight. Bertrand died on January 27, 2007 from Ovarian cancer in Los Angeles, California, aged 56.
