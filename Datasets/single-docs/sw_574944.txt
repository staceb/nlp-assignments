Religious Zionism

Religious Zionism (Hebrew: ציונות דתית - "Tziyonut Datit") is a branch of Zionism. It is a combination of Zionism and Judaism.

Religious Zionists are in favour of a State of Israel, that is mainly populated by Jews and dominated by Judaism.

In their view the State of Israel should encompass the entire Land of Israel ("Eretz Yisrael"). This includes the so-called Palestinian territories (West Bank, Gaza Strip) and also the Golan Heights.

Religious Zionism dominates Modern Orthodox Judaism in Israel.

Politically Religious Zionists can especially be found in HaBayit HaYehudi (The Jewish Home) but also in HaLikud.
