Vagrancy (biology)

Vagrancy is a phenomenon in biology when animals appear very far from their normal range. These animals are called vagrants. The term accidental can be used as well. There are a number of reasons for such animals to become a vagrant - such as weather conditions - but these causes are still rather confused.

Vagrancy is known to occur in birds, insects, mammals and turtles.
