Kurwai State

Kurwai state was a Muslim-ruled Princely state of British India, centered around the Kurwai town. The state was 368 km² in area and had a population of 30,631 in 1892.

It was founded in 1713 by Mohammed Diler Khan, an Afghan soldier in the Mughal Army. Abida Sultan, the wife of the last ruler, gave up her right to the throne of Bhopal State and opted for the Muslim Nation state of Pakistan in 1950, eventually entering that country's Foreign service. Later, her son Shaharyar Khan became the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan and then the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board.
