Patti LaBelle

Patti LaBelle (born Patricia Louise Holt on May 24, 1944) is an American R&B and Soul singer. She is known for her high vocal belting (using the chest to make high pitch sounds). She is known for such songs as "New Attitude" and "On My Own".

She was the lead singer of Patty La Belle and the Bluebells during the 1960s and 70s. Later the group was known as simply "Labell". In this later group the style was more laid back, singing hits like The Rolling Stones' "Wild Horses".
