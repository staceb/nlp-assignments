Bernese mountain dog

The Bernese Mountain Dog is a breed of dog from Switzerland. 

These dogs are "tricolour", which means their coat of fur is made up of three colors: black, white, and tan. They are gentle, loyal, and good with children. Bernese Mountain Dogs are very large dogs, weighing from 70 to 120 pounds (32 to 54 kilograms) as adults. They were first used to pull carts and worked as all-around farm dogs.
