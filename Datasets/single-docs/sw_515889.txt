Unwell

Unwell is the second single from Matchbox Twenty's third album, "More Than You Think You Are". It was written by Matchbox Twenty lead singer Rob Thomas. It was very successful on the radio, and spent 20 weeks at the top of the U.S. Adult Top 40 charts. The song is about a person who claims to not be crazy even though they're suffering from various occurrences that could lead them to be labeled as such. Rob Thomas states on the live DVD "Show" that he wrote the song to be a metaphor for humanity in general, a song for people who are "fucked up and feel alone like that. We all feel a little fucked up sometimes... you're not alone." This song is a staple of adult contemporary stations even years after its release. The song also was the second most played song in the United States for 2003 according to Billboard.
