Eric Burdon

Eric Burdon (*11 May, 1941 in Newcastle, UK) is an English rock singer. He is known for his very loud screaming and performing. 

He began his career in the early 1960s with the R&B/blues-based punk rock band The Animals. They had hits such as "House of the Rising Sun", "See See Rider", "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood", "Inside Looking Out", "We Gotta Get Out Of This Place", "Don't Bring Me Down" and "It's My Life".

He later formed "Eric Burdon & The Animals" in 1967. He continued to have chart success with songs like "San Franciscan Nights", "When I Was Young", "Good Times", "Sky Pilot", "Monterey" and "Ring of Fire".

In late 1969, he formed the radical funk/soul/jazz band "Eric Burdon & War". They had hits with "Spill the Wine", "Tobacco Road", "Paint it Black" and "They Can't Take Away Our Music". He left them during their European tour in early 1971 to start a solo career, which has seen him in the genres of heavy metal, glam rock, new age, pop rock, reggae, hip hop and many more.

After some successful world tours and acting roles in movies, he went on to record with Brian Auger as a psychedelic fusion rock band in the 1990s. 

After forming several groups such as "Eric Burdon Band" or "The New Animals", he released his first solo album in many years, "My Secret Life" (2004), which had many musical directions, like hard rock, jazz, progressive and folk.

In the following year he released "Athens Traffic Live" and "Soul of a Man".
