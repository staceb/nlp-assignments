Chinstrap penguin

The chinstrap penguin ("Pygoscelis antarctica") is a penguin that gets its name from the narrow band of black feathers that goes under their "chin" from ear to ear. They are sometimes called the ‘stone-cracker penguin’ because of their squeaky and high pitched call. Chinstrap penguins are found in polar, shallow seas and coastal areas. Some penguins are born very pale and are called ‘Blonde’ penguins. There are more chinstrap penguins than any other penguins in the world.

They feed mainly on krill and fish. The chinstrap penguins make nests in round shapes made from small stones and take turns in sitting on the eggs, they can be left on the nest for 10 days. 

These little penguins are only about tall and weigh about . Chinstraps may be small, but they are the boldest penguins of all.
