John Macarthur (wool pioneer)

John Macarthur (1766 – 11 April 1834) was a soldier, business man, politician and the man who started the Australian wool industry. His farmhouse, called Elizabeth Farm after his wife, is still standing in Parramatta, New South Wales, where it is open to the public as a historic house.
