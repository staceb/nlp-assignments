Third Fleet

The Third Fleet was a group of 11 ships that sailed to Australia in 1971. It was part of the British colonisation of Australia. The ships left Great Britain in February, March and April 1791, and sailed for the penal colony in Sydney. They carried more than 2,000 convicts aboard. The other passengers included soldiers, politicians and nobles sent to hold important positions in the colony.
