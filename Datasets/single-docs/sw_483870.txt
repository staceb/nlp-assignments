IC 342/Maffei Group

The IC 342/Maffei Group (also known as the "IC 342 Group" or the "Maffei 1 Group") is the nearest group of galaxies to the Local Group. The group is basically a binary group. The member galaxies are mostly concentrated around either IC 342 or Maffei 1, which are the brightest galaxies in the group. 

The group, and the Local Group, are in the Virgo Supercluster (i.e. the Local Supercluster).
