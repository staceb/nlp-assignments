Mnemonic

A mnemonic is a way for people to remember things more easily. For example the treble clef lines on a music staff are for the notes E G B D and F. Music students are taught to remember this with a mnemonic - Every Good Boy Does Fine. The first known mnemonics were used by the Ancient Greeks. Cicero said the poet Simonides (c.556-c.468 B.C) discovered the power of mnemonics to help him make visual images so he could remember things. The word "mnemonic" comes from the Greek words "mnene", meaning memory and "mnemon", meaning mindful.
