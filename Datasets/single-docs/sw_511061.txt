Stapleton International Airport

Stapleton International Airport was Denver, Colorado's primary airport from 1929 to 1995. At different times it served as a hub for Continental Airlines, Frontier Airlines, People Express, TWA, United Airlines and Western Airlines.

In 1995, Stapleton was replaced by Denver International Airport. It has now been decommissioned and the airport property was redeveloped as a retail and residential neighborhood.
