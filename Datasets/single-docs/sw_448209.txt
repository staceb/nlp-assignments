Drachensee (Ehrwald)

The Drachensee is a lake in Austria which is a few meters below of Coburger Hütte. It is at about 1910 meters (6 266 feet) attitude. If you climb up above Coburger Hütte at most of the high peeks it will be seen. It is very similiar to the Seebensee which is lower down the Drachensee and on the other side of Coburger Hütte .
