INS Dakar Memorial

The INS "Dakar" Memorial is a memorial dedicated to the 69 soldiers of the Israeli Navy of the submarine INS "Dakar" who died in the Mediterranean Sea in 1969. The remains of the submarine were found in 1999. The memorial is located in the Garden of the Missing Soldiers in the National Military and Police Cemetery in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem. It is next to the wall of the names of the missing soldiers of Israel. The memorial was built with exposed concrete in a shape of a submarine; the lower half is submerged in the ground. On the front side a verse from the Bible is inscribed: Psalm 77:19: "Your path led through the sea, your way through the mighty waters, though Your footprints were not seen." Inside the memorial is the room with all the 69 names of the soldiers that died at sea. The memorial was built in 1970 by the architect David Anatol Brotzkos.
