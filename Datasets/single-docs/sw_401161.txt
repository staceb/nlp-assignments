Roy Rockwood

Roy Rockwood is the pseudonym created by the Stratemeyer Syndicate for the team of ghostwriters who wrote the syndicate's boys' adventure books. The name is best remembered for the Bomba the Jungle Boy and the Great Marvel series.


In addition to Garis and Duffield, some of these books were also written by Leslie McFarlane and W. Bert Foster. Edward Stratemeyer had earlier used the pseudonym "Roy Rockwood" for the book "The Wizard of the Sea; or a Trip Under the Ocean", published by the Mershon Company in 1900.
