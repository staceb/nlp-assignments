Savannah River

The Savannah River is a major river in the southeastern United States. It makes up most of the border between the states of South Carolina and Georgia. The Savannah River drainage basin extends into the southeastern side of the Appalachian Mountains just inside North Carolina. It is bounded by the Eastern Continental Divide. It is formed by the confluence of the Tugaloo River and the Seneca River. Today this confluence is under Lake Hartwell, a man-made reservoir. From Lake Hartwell to the Atlantic Ocean the Savannah River is long.

Two major cities are located along the Savannah River: Savannah, and Augusta, Georgia. They were the center of early English settlements during the Colonial period of American history. The Savannah River is tidal at Savannah. Downstream from there, the river widens into an estuary. Then it flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The area where the river's estuary meets the ocean is known as "Tybee Roads". The Intracoastal Waterway flows through a section of the Savannah River near the city of Savannah.
