Amateur Athletic Union

The Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) is a sports organization in the United States. It was founded in 1888. It holds meets in many sports for amateur athletes (athletes who do not get paid) of all ages. These sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, and track. A long time ago, when most athletes were amateurs, winning an AAU title meant that you were one of the best in your sport. In the United States, AAU meets used to also be trials for the Olympic Games. Since 1978, the AAU has lost most of its power. This is due to the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 and the fact that many good athletes are no longer amateurs. It is currently based in Lake Buena Vista, Florida at Disney's Wide World of Sports.
