Pre-production

Pre-production is the time before making a movie, play, or other performance when all the things that will be needed to make it are prepared.

In the movie industry, pre-production usually only starts when the script is ready, the studio has agreed to make it and money has been made available. By this time, a project will almost always have a movie, a producer, cast members and a production team.
