Federal Republic of Central America

The Federal Republic of Central America was known as the United Provinces of Central America in its first year of creation. It was an independent nation in Central America. It was made up of the former territories of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. It existed from September 1821 to 1841. It was a republican democracy. 

The republic was made up of the present-day countries of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica (Panama was part of the Republica de Colombia in 1821). Los Altos was added to the republic in the 1830's. Its capital was Quetzaltenango. Although the nation was independent of Spain, it had been annexed by the First Mexican Empire.
