Gary Holt

Gary Wayne Holt (born May 4, 1964 in Richmond, California) is an American guitarist. He currently plays for the thrash metal bands Exodus and Slayer.

He joined Exodus in 1981 when guitarist Tim Agnello left the band. He is the only member of Exodus to have played on every one of their albums. He joined Slayer as a fill-in for guitarist Jeff Hanneman who was out after he contracted necrotizing fasciitis. He played with Slayer at the Big 4 Concert in Indio, California on April 23, 2011. After Jeff Hanneman died on May 2, 2013, Holt agreed to fill in and still tours for Slayer.

He said in an interview that his favorite bands are Venom, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, early Iron Maiden and Judas Priest.

He will provide some guitar solos on Slayer's eleventh studio album with the rest of the guitar work being done by Kerry King. King said that Holt would not be participating in writing and said that "fans aren't ready for it."
