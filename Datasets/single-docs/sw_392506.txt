Mount Crombie

Mount Crombie () is a mountain in the northwest of South Australia. It is a outcrop of granitic rock. It is located about south of Amaṯa. The mountain is part of the traditional country of the Pitjantjatjara people, and there are several examples of rock art in the area.

The last recorded specimen of the lesser stick-nest rat, which used to be found throughout central Australia, was captured here in 1933.
