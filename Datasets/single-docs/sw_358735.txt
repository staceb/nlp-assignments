GamePro

Gamepro was an ancient American video game magazine. It focuses on anything to do with video games (such as the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii), PCs and even mobile devices (such as the PlayStation Portable, Nintendo DS, iPhone). Gamepro Media had owned and published the monthly magazine issue and the official website Gamepro.com. The company was also a partly-owned subsidiary of International Data Group (IDG), a technology media, events and research company.

The very first issue of Gamepro was originally published in April 1989. It was a monthly magazine and had its last headquarters based in Oakland, California from June 2002 through May 2015. The official website of the magazine launched in 1998. It was updated daily and had included several game articles, news, previews, reviews, game screenshots and gaming videos on various video games, video game console system platform hardware and video game software development upon in the entertainment gaming industry. The official website also included various user forums, game reviews and other interesting game blogs as well. The official website's headquarters was then and formerly based in San Francisco from May 1998 through May 2002.

Gamepro is currently now-defunct as a magazine and a website.

Gamepro would only then now become part of the PC World website, covering on the latest and most recently developed video games in the entertainment video gaming industry, and to which is now currently being run by the new PC World staff.
