1850 United States Census

The United States Census of 1850 was the seventh census of the United States. It was done on June 1, 1850. It found the population of the United States to be 23,191,876. This was an increase of 35.9 percent from the 1840 Census. The total population included 3,204,313 slaves.

This was the first census where there was an attempt to collect information about every member of every household, including women, children, and slaves. It was also the first census to ask about place of birth.

Hinton Rowan Helper made use of the 1850 census results in his politically notorious book "The Impending Crisis of the South".
