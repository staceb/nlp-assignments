Brake van

Brake van and guard's van are terms used mainly in the UK and Australia for a railway vehicle that has a hand brake which can be applied by the guard. The equivalent North American term is caboose but a British brake van and a caboose are very different in appearance because the former usually has only four wheels while the latter usually has bogies.
