McQueen was born on 17 March 1969 in Lewisham, London. He started drawing at age three. He wanted to be a designer since he was in primary school. McQueen left school at age 16 and started to serve an apprenticeship with Savile Row tailors in 'Anderson & Sheppard'. Afterwards, he also worked for 'Gieves & Hawkes', which made stage costumes for famous shows in London. The skills he learned as an apprentice on Savile Row helped him to get a reputation in the fashion world. At the age of 21, McQueen was hired by Romeo Gigli as assistant designer in Italy.
In 1994, McQueen returned to London and got a master's degree from Central Saint Martins College. It was the turning point that led him to be a designer. McQueen worked at Givenchy as a head designer from 1996 to 2001. After he separated with Givenchy, he focused on his own label. Then, in 2001, he made a debut with "The Dance of the Twisted Bull" collection in Paris which provoked some scandals.
In 2001 "Gucci" Group got 51% shares of Alexander McQueen brand, which was named after McQueen, and became his new partner. As time passed, McQueen launched "McQ" as second brand, and "My Queen" as perfume brand. McQueen also conducted various brand and design collaboration with Puma, Samsonite and Chivas Regal. By the end of 2006, Alexander McQueen brand has entered 25 cities including London, Paris, New York, Boston, Milan, Moscow, Tokyo and Seoul.

Moreover, in 2003 he was nominated as by Council of Fashion Designers of America(CFDA) and received 'Commander of the Order of the British Empire' from Queen. From mid 1990s to 2000s, he had success in his career.

McQueen was openly gay. He suffered from depression since the suicide of his close friend Isabella Blow. He hanged himself at his London home nine days after from the death of his mother. Depression was presumed to be the cause of his suicide. After his death, Sarah Burton is now the chief designer of the Alexander McQueen business.
