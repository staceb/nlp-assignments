Caenagnathasia

Caenagnathasia (meaning 'recent jaw from Asia') was a small oviraptorosaurian dinosaur (superfamily Caenagnathoidea), measuring only 1 m (3 ft) in length and weighing around 8 kg (18 lb). Like all oviraptorosaurs, "Caenagnathasia" had three fingers on each 'hand' and three toes on each 'foot', with bone fusion similar to that of birds. 

"Caenagnathasia" lived in the Upper Cretaceous, around 90 million years ago.
