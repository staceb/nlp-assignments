Anti-lock braking system

An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a safety system that prevents the wheels of a vehicle (for example car, motorcycle) from locking up when it is strongly braked. The goal is to keep the vehicle controllable, because a wheeled vehicle can only be safely steered when its wheels are not skidding.
