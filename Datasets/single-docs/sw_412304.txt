Interest rate

An interest rate is how much interest is paid by borrowers for the money that they borrow. It is usually a percentage of the sum borrowed. So, a simple 10% interest means that if one borrows £100, one pays back £110. 

Interest rates in a country are usually guided by a base rate set by its central bank. The interest rate to businesses and citizens is always above the base rate.
