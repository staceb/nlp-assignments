Microsoft Publisher

Microsoft Publisher is a desktop publishing application (program). It is made by Microsoft and it is part of Microsoft Office. Publisher is similar to Word except that it places the emphasis on page layout and design (rather than writing text and proof reading). With Publisher, you can create a variety of publication types. For example, you can make brochures, newsletters, postcards and greeting cards as well as normal, 'Word-like' documents. Publisher's file extension is ".pub". The current version is 2013 for Windows; there is no version for Macintosh.
