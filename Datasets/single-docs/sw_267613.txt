Sodium telluride

Sodium telluride is a chemical compound. Its chemical formula is NaTe. It contains sodium and telluride ions. 

It is a white solid when pure. It reacts with air to make a mixture of tellurium and tellurides, which would make gray or purple colors. It eventually turns into sodium carbonate and tellurium when in air. It is a powerful reducing agent. It reacts with strong acids to make hydrogen telluride. It reacts with water to make sodium hydrogen telluride, NaHTe.

Sodium telluride is made by reacting tellurium and sodium in liquid ammonia. 

Sodium telluride is used to make organic tellurium compounds. It also can act as a reducing agent.
