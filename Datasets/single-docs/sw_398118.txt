Chris Christie

Christopher James "Chris" Christie (born September 6, 1962) is an American politician. In 2010, he became the 55th Governor of New Jersey. He was the first Republican to win a statewide election in New Jersey in 12 years. 

Some people thought Christie was a leading candidate for the Republican Presidential nomination in 2016. He announced his presidential campaign on June 30, 2015. After poor polling numbers and not winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Christie suspended his campaign on February 10, 2016. On July 12, 2016, it was reported that Christie was on Trump's three-person shortlist to be his running mate in the general election. On July 14, 2016, the Trump campaign announced that Governor of Indiana Mike Pence would be Trump's running mate.

In March 2017, it was announced Christie was to chair the Trump administration's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission.

Christie was born on September 6, 1962 in Newark, New Jersey. He is of Irish-Scottish-Sicilian descent. He was raised in Livingston, New Jersey. Christie studied at the University of Delaware and at Seton Hall University. 

Christie joined a Cranford, New Jersey, law firm in 1987, rose to become a partner in 1993, and continued practicing until 2002. 

He was elected county legislator in Morris County, serving from 1995 to 1998, during which time he generally pushed for lower taxes and lower spending. By 2002, Christie had campaigned for Presidents George H. W. Bush and George W. Bush. Bush appointed him as United States Attorney for New Jersey, a position he held from 2002 to 2008. In that position, he fought political corruption and also obtained convictions for sexual slavery, arms trafficking, racketeering by gangs, and other federal crimes.

In January 2009, Christie declared his candidacy for Governor of New Jersey. He won the Republican primary, and defeated incumbent Governor Jon Corzine in the election that November. In 2013, he won re-election as Governor, defeating Democrat Barbara Buono by a margin of over 22%. He was sworn in to a second term as governor on January 21, 2014. 

As governor, Christie has promised not to raise taxes. He has also vowed to lower the state income and business taxes. On September 18, 2013, Christie signed legislation to overhaul the state's business tax incentive programs. 

Christie is a strong supporter of the state granting tax credits to parents who send their children to private and parochial schools.
He also supports the introduction of state-funded vouchers, which parents of students in failing school districts could use to pay the tuition of private schools.

Christie has stated that he believes that the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection is too big and is "killing business" with permit delays. In January 2013 Christie vetoed a New Jersey Legislature bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $7.25 to $8.50 per hour. Christie supports gay marriage, but said that he would not pass a bill allowing gay marriage in New Jersey. He also supports the DREAM Act and illegal immigrants.

On November 21, 2013, Christie was elected Chairman of the Republican Governors Association, succeeding Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal.

On June 27, 2015, Christie launched his presidential campaign website. He announced his candidacy for the 2016 presidential election on June 30, 2015. After poor polling numbers and not winning the Iowa and New Hampshire primaries, Christie suspended his campaign on February 10, 2016. He later endorsed Donald Trump.

Despite having criticized Donald Trump prior to leaving the race, he endorsed Trump on February 26, 2016. On May 9, 2016, Trump named Christie to head up a transition team in the event of a Trump presidency. He soon emerged as a major power with the Trump campaign. It was then announced on July 12, 2016 that Trump had narrowed down his vice presidential shortlist to three candidates, including Christie. Mike Pence eventually became Trump's running mate.

He has been married to Mary Pat Foster since 1986. They have four children.
