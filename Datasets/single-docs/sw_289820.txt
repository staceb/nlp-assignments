Warkany syndrome 2

Warkany syndrome 2, also known as chromosome 8 trisomy syndrome or trisomy 8, is a condition where chromosome 8 in humans has three sets of chromosomes, as opposed to the normal two. This condition is called "trisomy", and is where Warkany syndrome 2 derives its alternative names. People born with Warkany syndrome 2 typically have mental retardation and renal or skeletal malformations.
