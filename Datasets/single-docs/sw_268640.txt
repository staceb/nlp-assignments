Xiaosaurus

Xiaosaurus (means "dawn lizard)" was a small, plant-eating dinosaur. It walked on two long legs, had four-toed feet, five-fingered hands, short arms, a long, stiff, pointed tail, a flexible neck, and a small head with large eyes.
This early dinosaur ornithischian lived during the mid-Jurassic period, about 169–163 million years ago. It was small and lizard-like, about four feet (1.2 m) long – smaller than an adult human. Fossils of this dinosaur were found in China.
