Sucralose

Sucralose is an artificial sweetener, most of which, if ingested, will not be broken down by the body and is thereby non-caloric. Sucralose is almost 600 times as sweet as sucrose, twice as sweet as saccharin and 3 times as sweet as aspartame. It is stable under heat and over a broad range of pH condition, meaning it can be used in baking or products which require longer shelf lives. It was first discovered and patented in 1976.
