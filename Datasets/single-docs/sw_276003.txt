Canine distemper

Canine distemper is a viral disease that affects animals in the families Canidae, Mustelidae, Mephitidae, Procyonidae and some Felidae (though not domestic cats: feline distemper or panleukopenia is a different virus exclusive to cats). It is most commonly associated with domestic animals such as dogs and ferrets, although it can infect wild animals as well. It is a single-stranded RNA virus of the family paramyxovirus, and thus a close relative of measles and rinderpest. Despite extensive vaccination in many regions, it remains a major disease of dogs.
