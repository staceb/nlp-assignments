Chador

A chador (Persian چادر) is a piece of clothing. It is for Muslim women. In Iran, women wear a chador in public. The Chador covers all the body except the face. However some religious women, cover their faces with their chador too.

A chador is a full-length semi-circle of fabric open down the front. It is thrown over the head and held shut in front. A chador has no hand openings or closures but is held shut by the hands or by wrapping the ends around the waist.
