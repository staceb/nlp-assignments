Érik Bédard

Érik Joseph Bédard (born March 6, 1979 in Navan, Ontario) is a Canadian baseball player. As of 2013, he is a pitcher for the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball.

He made his MLB debut for the Baltimore Orioles on April 17, 2002. He played for the Orioles in 2002 but suffered an elbow ligament injury that forced him to have operations on it and set his development back 18 months. After he spent most of the 2003 season in rehab, he returned to baseball. On July 7, he struck out 15 Texas Rangers, which matched the Orioles franchise record that was set by Mike Mussina. His 15 strikeouts also set the record for the most in a game by a Canadian player. He earned the American League Pitcher of the month award in that month.

On February 8, 2008, he was traded to the Seattle Mariners in a 5-for-1 deal which sent outfielder Adam Jones and pitchers George Sherrill, Tony Butler, Chris Tillman and Kam Mickolio. He played for the Mariners from 2008 to 2009 and again in 2011.

On July 31, 2011, he was traded along with minor league pitcher Josh Fields to the Boston Red Sox for minor league outfielders Trayvon Robinson and Chih-Hsien Chiang as part of a three team deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers and Seattle Mariners.

He played for the Red Sox in 2011. He was then signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates to a one-year, $4.5 million contract on December 7, 2011. He was released by the Pirates in August after he had 7 wins, 14 losses and an ERA of 5.02 in 24 starts.

On January 21, 2013, the Houston Astros signed him to a minor-league deal.
