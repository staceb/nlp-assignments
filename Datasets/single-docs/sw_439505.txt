Charlotte Dawson

Charlotte Dawson (8 April 1966 – 22 February 2014) was a New Zealand-Australian television presenter, model and activist. She was best known as a host on "The Contender Australia" and as a judge on "Australia's Next Top Model".

She was born in Auckland, New Zealand. At age sixteen, she worked as a model in Europe and with Ford Models, New York in the United States. In 1999, she married Olympic swimmer Scott Miller. The couple divorced in 2000.

Dawson committed suicide by hanging on the morning of 22 February 2014 at her home in Woolloomooloo, Sydney, New South Wales. She was 47 years old. Police said they were called to the home at 11:18 a.m. and that there were no suspicious circumstances to the death. She had a long history of depression. She tried to commit suicide in August 2012, after a much publicised battle with Twitter trolls.

Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key said he was "shocked" and "saddened" by her death.
