Raul Soares Square

The Praça Raul Soares is a large public square in the city of Belo Horizonte, in Brazil. It is built in the French style. It is located where four major roads meet. The roads are Amazonas, Augusto de Lima, Bias Fortes and Olegário Maciel. The square is named in honor of the former governor of Minas Gerais, Raul Soares de Moura. 

In 2008, the square was renovated. The flowerbeds, sidewalks and fountains were fixed up. Some trees were replaced, lamp posts were resized, and advertisements were removed or adjusted. The walks were improved to provide easier access for disabled and blind people. This was paid for by the city's government. It cost about $2,600,000 U.S. dollars. The project aimed to make the square safer and easier for pedestrians.
