Tropical Storm Beryl

Tropical Storm Beryl was a strong Atlantic tropical storm. It was the second tropical cyclone of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season. Beryl formed on May 26 from a low-pressure system. This system was near the East Coast of the United States. It was described as a subtropical storm. However, it slowly became stronger and was upgraded to a tropical storm on May 27. It upgraded because it moved to warmer water. Beryl is responsible for floods in Cuba. This caused a mudslide that left two people missing. Beryl caused rough surf to beaches in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. In South Carolina, one person was reported missing.
