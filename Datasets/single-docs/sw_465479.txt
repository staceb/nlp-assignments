Cigar (horse)

Cigar (April 18, 1990 – October 7, 2014) was an American thoroughbred racehorse. In 1995 and 1996, Cigar won 16 races in a row. He was the first American racehorse racing against top-class competition to do that since Citation in 1948 and 1950. When Cigar retired, he had made more money than any other American Thoroughbred racehorse. He is now in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

Cigar died from spinal surgery complications in Lexington, Kentucky, aged 24.
