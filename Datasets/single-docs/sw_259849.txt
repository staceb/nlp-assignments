Wibbling Rivalry

"Wibbling Rivalry" is the title of a single released under the name "Oas*s" by the Fierce Panda record label in 1995. It is a recording of John Harris interviewing brothers Noel Gallagher and Liam Gallagher of Oasis in early 1994. The musicians live up to their reputation as fighting siblings by getting sidetracked into an argument over an incident that happened on a ferry. The title is a portmanteau of the expression sibling rivalry and the word wibble.

The single contains a 'Liam Track' featuring predominantly Liam's use of profanities and a 'Noel Track' featuring Noel. "Wibbling Rivalry" holds the record as the highest charting interview release in the UK, reaching number 52 on November 25, 1995.
