The Hockey News

The Hockey News, commonly shortened to THN, is a North American ice hockey magazine published by Transcontinental. "The Hockey News" was created in 1947 by Ken McKenzie and Bill Côté, and has since been the most recognized hockey publication in North America. Over 225,000 people read each issue of the magazine, and the website has another two million people reading it.

A total of 34 regular versions are made every year. Another seven special magazines — the Season Opener, People of Power and Influence, Future Watch, Draft Preview, Season in Review, the Best of Everything in Hockey, and the Yearbook — are made every year as well. Most of the magazine is about the National Hockey League and written by local writers of the different teams. Other hockey leagues are also included, but they are discussed in less detail.
